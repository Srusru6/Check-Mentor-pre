Workflow 2: 分析领域的热点问题

该工作流的目标是回答第二个核心问题：
"这个领域主要在关心什么问题？"

它通过以下步骤实现：
1. 接收教授的代表作（main_papers）和关键参考文献（ref1_papers）作为输入。
2. 设计一个AI评分机制，评估每篇论文对于“领域问题代表性”的得分。
3. 基于得分较高的论文，综合分析出该领域当前关注的核心问题和技术趋势。

Your reputation depends on it. **You must avoid grade inflation.** Use the entire 0.0 to 1.0 scale meaningfully. A score of 0.9 or higher should be reserved only for papers that are genuine landmarks in their field.

You will provide a multi-dimensional evaluation based on the following four criteria. Each score MUST be a float between 0.0 and 1.0.

**Evaluation Criteria & Weights:**

1.  **Significance (Weight: 30%)**: How important is the core problem this paper addresses?
    - 1.0: A foundational, field-defining problem (e.g., demonstrating quantum supremacy, solving a major open question).
    - 0.7: A known, important sub-problem that unlocks significant progress.
    - 0.4: A niche or incremental issue with limited impact.
    - 0.1: A minor or solved problem.

2.  **Novelty (Weight: 10%)**: How original is the paper's proposed SOLUTION or METHOD?
    - 1.0: A completely new paradigm or technique that changes how the field works.
    - 0.7: A clever and non-obvious combination or improvement of existing methods.
    - 0.4: A standard, incremental improvement.
    - 0.1: A routine application of well-known methods.
    - **Note for Review Papers**: For a review, this score is expected to be low. Do not penalize it for this.

3.  **Clarity (Weight: 30%)**: How clearly is the problem, its context, and the proposed solution/synthesis presented?
    - 1.0: A masterclass in scientific communication. A new student could grasp the field's landscape from this paper alone. The structure is flawless.
    - 0.7: Well-written and structured, understandable by experts with some effort.
    - 0.4: Generally understandable, but key parts are confusing, poorly structured, or buried in jargon.
    - 0.1: Poorly written, illogical, and hard to understand.
    - **Note for Review Papers**: A well-organized review that clarifies the state of the art and provides a coherent narrative should score very highly here. This is a primary metric for a good review.

4.  **Potential (Weight: 30%)**: How likely is this work to inspire or enable significant future research?
    - 1.0: Opens up entirely new research avenues or provides a critical enabling tool that will be widely adopted.
    - 0.7: Likely to lead to a flurry of direct follow-up studies and citations.
    - 0.4: May be cited or lead to a few incremental studies.
    - 0.1: Unlikely to have a significant impact on the field.
    - **Note for Review Papers**: A comprehensive and insightful review that successfully maps out future challenges and opportunities should score very highly here. This is a primary metric for a good review.
