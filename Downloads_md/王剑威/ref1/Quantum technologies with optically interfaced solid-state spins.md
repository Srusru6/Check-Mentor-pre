Spins of impurities in solids provide a unique architecture to realize quantum technologies. A quantum register of electron and nearby nuclear spins in the lattice encompasses high-fidelity state manipulation and readout, long-lived quantum memory, and long-distance transmission of quantum states by optical transitions that coherently connect spins and photons. These features, combined with solid-state device engineering, establish impurity spins as promising resources for quantum networks, information processing and sensing. Focusing on optical methods for the access and connectivity of single spins, we review recent progress in impurity systems such as colour centres in diamond and silicon carbide, rare-earth ions in solids and donors in silicon. We project a possible path to chip-scale quantum technologies through sustained advances in nanofabrication, quantum control and materials engineering.

Driven by the quest for efficiency, modern technologies developed through persistent miniaturization. Devices such as transistors, magnetic memories and lasers advanced by reducing the number of electrons used per gate, bit, or output photon. This progression's arrival at the quantum limit now inspires a new class of information processing hardware that starts with the quantum coherence of single charges, spins, or photons and grows by harnessing the inseparable connections among them. This reversal from scaling down to building up lies at the heart of radical technologies that promise breakthroughs in computational power, communications security and sensor detection limit.

Solid-state spins are a promising platform for realizing these quantum advantages because of their robustness to decoherence and compatibility with scalable device engineering. In particular, this Review focuses on optically addressed electron and nuclear spins at impurities in crystals. In recent years, pioneering experiments have isolated single spins at these atomic-scale impurities and demonstrated high-fidelity initialization, manipulation and readout of their quantum states. These advances at the single-qubit level establish a critical foundation, but the connectivity among multiple qubits is required to unlock their full potential. We highlight the capacity of hybrid quantum registers formed by an electron spin coupled to multiple nuclear spins in its proximity. Electron spins readily sense and interface to the outside environment, while nuclear spins provide well-isolated quantum memories. These complementary functionalities, accessed through the generation of entangled states, enable an array of applications, including photonic memories, quantum repeaters, error correction and enhanced quantum sensing.

We concentrate on solid-state spins that utilize optical electronic transitions to fulfil several of the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum information processing. Optical pumping can directly initialize the electron spin and its coupled nuclear spins, or, alternatively, coherent manipulations can transfer optically generated electron spin polarization to nuclear memories. Additionally, spin-dependent optical

cycles correlate spin information to photon emission, enabling sensitive readout of spin states. Such remarkable optical properties of defect systems have been combined with techniques adapted from atomic physics and magnetic resonance to enable experiments on single electron and nuclear spins at ambient conditions, surpassing limitations in the original fields. Moreover, spin-selective optical transitions, accessed at cryogenic temperatures, coherently map between the quantum states of local spins and propagating photons $^{10,11}$ . This light/matter interface establishes each electron as a quantum gateway to distribute and process entanglement between distant registers in a quantum network.

We aim to provide an introduction and broad update on optically active impurity systems, emphasizing the partnership between electron and nuclear spins. We first describe the framework for manipulating hybrid quantum registers in the context of the prototype defect system, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond<sup>8</sup>. We briefly review the optical and coherence properties of the NV electron spin, which provides access to the entire register. This discussion identifies the nuclear spin bath as the dominant source of decoherence, but leads to the opportunity to control selected nuclear memories via their distinct hyperfine interaction. We then overview emerging impurity systems, including alternative colour centres in diamond and silicon carbide, rare-earth ions in solids and optically active donors in silicon. These platforms offer unique advantages, such as in their optical properties or integrability with electronic or photonic devices, and stand to benefit from techniques developed for the NV centre. Then, we focus on technological applications of registers of quantum memories, ranging from quantum communication, computing and sensing. We conclude our Review by looking ahead to future challenges and progress with impurity spins in solids.

We remark that spins in self-assembled $^{12,13}$  and gate-defined quantum dots $^{14}$  share many parallel directions with impurity spins, including achievement of extended coherence times and enhanced light-matter coupling to enable multi-qubit interactions and

single-photon nonlinearities. The rapidly advancing state of the art in this field is, however, beyond the scope of our discussion. Likewise, we will overlook two-dimensional material systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, that have recently emerged as hosts for single quantum emitters $^{15-17}$ . For these materials, explorations towards using the valley or spin degree of freedom of excitons or defect states as qubits are still in their infancy, but could open functionalities for quantum photonics, optoelectronics and sensing unattainable in bulk materials.

# The nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond

Consisting of a substitutional nitrogen impurity adjacent to a missing carbon atom, the negatively charged NV centre in diamond traps six electrons at localized atomic-like states, protected from charge scattering by diamond's wide bandgap (Fig. 1a). NV centres display room-temperature quantum coherence, spin-photon entanglement and functionality inside engineered nanostructures, establishing their versatility for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing.

The electron spin and its optical interface. The NV electron spin can be off-resonantly excited from its spin-triplet ground state (GS) to a spin-triplet, orbital-doublet excited state (ES) via phonon-assisted optical absorption. Owing to a non-radiative, spin-flip decay channel that preferentially couples to the  $m_{s} = \pm 1$  sublevels of the excited state, repeated optical cycling initializes the electron spin into the  $m_{s} = 0$  level ( $\sim 90\%$  polarization). Concurrently, off-resonant excitation of  $|m_{s} = \pm 1\rangle$  results in  $\sim 30\%$  lower photoluminescence (PL) than  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$ , allowing optical determination of the spin state at room temperature. Higher-fidelity initialization and readout are obtained by cooling diamond below  $10\mathrm{K}$ , where distinct spin-selective, zero-phonon optical transitions are resolved (Fig. 1b). Resonant optical pumping of a spin-mixed transition (for example  $|m_{s} = \pm 1\rangle \rightarrow |\mathrm{A}_{1}\rangle$ ) fully initializes the NV centre into  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$  ( $>99.7\%$  polarization). Alternatively, by resonant excitation of a cycling transition ( $|m_{s} = 0\rangle \rightarrow |\mathrm{E}_{x}\rangle$  or  $|\mathrm{E}_{y}\rangle$ ) and optimizing photon-collection efficiency, the electron spin state can be determined without averaging multiple preparations ( $>97\%$  fidelity averaged for  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$  and  $|m_{s} = \pm 1\rangle$ ). Such single-shot measurements can be non-demolition to allow initialization of electron and nuclear spins by projective measurement. Moreover, these spin-dependent optical transitions and their polarization selection rules form the basis for spin-photon entanglement.

Aided by diamond's high Debye temperature and low spin-orbit coupling, NV centres possess long spin-lattice relaxation times  $T_{1}$  that reach  $\sim 5$  ms at room temperature and exceed hours at cryogenic temperatures  $(\sim 25\mathrm{mK})^{21,22}$ . In high-quality samples grown by chemical vapour deposition, low concentrations of paramagnetic impurities leave the bath of  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  nuclear spins (1.1% natural abundance) as the dominant magnetic noise[19]. This dephasing can be mitigated in isotopically enriched materials ( $>99.99\%$ $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ ). For single spins in isotopically purified samples, the inhomogeneous dephasing time  $T_{2}^{*}$ , reflecting temporal magnetic fluctuations, exceeds  $100~\mu \mathrm{s}$  at room temperature[23]. Dynamical decoupling further filters the noise spectrum and extends spin coherence to the homogeneous dephasing time  $T_{2}$  of several milliseconds at room temperature[24] and nearly seconds at low temperature, limited by direct lattice contributions to spin dephasing ( $T_{2} \approx 0.5T_{1}$ )[25] (Fig. 1c). These remarkable coherence times underpin the technological promise of NV centres, extending the range of this defect's access to nearby nuclear spins and enhancing its sensitivity to environmental influences.

Strongly coupled nuclear spins. While the nuclear bath represents the main contribution to electron spin decoherence, individual nuclear spins with isolated interactions offer a resource for quantum memories and multi-qubit entanglement<sup>9,26,27</sup>. Strongly

coupled nuclear spins, such as the intrinsic N forming the NV centre and proximal  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  atoms, possess hyperfine couplings larger than the electron spin resonance (ESR) linewidth, set by the dephasing rate  $1 / T_2^{\star}$  (Fig. 1a,d). For samples with natural isotope abundance, strongly coupled nuclei typically occur within  $1\mathrm{nm}$  from the electron and have hyperfine couplings from  $300\mathrm{kHz}$  to  $130\mathrm{MHz}$ , where the latter value corresponds to a  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  on a nearest-neighbour lattice site[28]. For these nuclei, narrow-band microwave pulses at the distinct ESR transition frequencies (Fig. 1d) perform rotations of the electron spin conditional on the nuclear spin state (for example, controlled NOT gate,  $\mathrm{C_nNOT_e}$ , where the subscripts n and e denote the nuclear and electron spin, respectively). Moreover, radio-frequency pulses can directly drive nuclear spin transitions  $(\Delta m_{\mathrm{I}} = \pm 1)$  conditional on the electron spin manifold (for example,  $\mathrm{C_eNOT_n})^{29}$ . Nuclear rotations can alternatively be implemented by nuclear Larmor precession for orthogonal nuclear quantization axes in different electron manifolds[9]. Using tailored pulse sequences of controlled two-qubit operations, the electron polarization can be transferred to the nuclear spin, after which the electron spin is reset by optical pumping[9,30].

Readout of the nuclear spin is achieved by mapping its population and coherences onto the electron spin using a combination of selective radio-frequency and microwave pulses $^{26}$ . In ref.  ${}^{31}$ , single-shot readout of the nuclear spin at room temperature was demonstrated by repeated application of electron-nuclear correlation  $(C_{\mathrm{n}}\mathrm{NOT}_{\mathrm{e}})$  and optical readout of the electron (Fig. 1e). This repetition leverages the robustness of the nuclear spin to optical excitation to accumulate sufficient photon statistics. Projective readout can initialize multiple strongly coupled nuclei if the  $C_{\mathrm{n}}\mathrm{NOT}_{\mathrm{e}}$  logic is conditional on each nuclear spin state of the multi-qubit register $^{18}$ .

The coherence times of nuclear spins and their sensitivity to optical illumination determine their usefulness as quantum memories. Nuclear coherence times  $T_{2n}$  exceed several milliseconds at room temperature and are limited by the electron spin relaxation time  $T_{1}$  and interactions with other nuclei. Control over the NV charge state, either by strong optical illumination or electrostatic gating, can effectively decouple or eliminate the electron spin, extending nuclear  $T_{2n}$  beyond several seconds by the former technique. For nuclear depolarization  $(T_{\mathrm{ln}})$ , transverse components of the hyperfine interaction drive electron-nuclear flip-flops. Since hyperfine interactions may be stronger in the excited state, optical excitation can exacerbate depolarization, requiring high magnetic fields to minimize this process for strongly coupled nuclear spins. In addition, these transverse terms become dominant near the excited-state anti-crossing  $(B \approx 500 \, \mathrm{G})$ , enabling optical excitation to drive dynamic nuclear polarization  $(\mathrm{DNP})^{34,35}$ . The DNP efficiency can approach unity, depending on the strength and direction of the hyperfine interaction. For quantum networks and error-corrected quantum computing, the coherences of nuclear spins must also be conserved under all operations performed with the electron spin. Failed remote entanglement attempts due to photon loss or errors in the electron spin readout randomize the electron spin, introducing an uncertainty to the nuclear memory's precession frequency and accumulated phase that cannot be refocused. Hence, these considerations have motivated the exploration of more distant nuclear memories that are less sensitive to electronic interference.

Weakly coupled nuclear spins. Access to nuclear spins with hyperfine couplings weaker than  $1 / T_2^*$  greatly increases the available number of register qubits and improves the longevity of each memory, at the expense of slower control speeds. This objective was achieved using dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences on the electron, thereby both extending its coherence and isolating its interaction with a particular nuclear spin[23,38,39]. The precession axis and frequency of a nuclear spin are conditional on the electron spin state and on its distinct hyperfine tensor (Fig. 1f). DD pulses that invert

Fig. 1 | The NV centre in diamond and nearby nuclear spins. a, Schematic of an NV-centre in diamond. The NV electron spin is coupled to proximal nuclear spins, such as its intrinsic  $^{14}\mathrm{N}$  and lattice  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ . b, PL into the phonon sideband (PSB) as the detuning of a laser is scanned across the NV centre ZPL (637.2 nm,  $T = 7\mathrm{K}$ ). Resonant transitions to six spin-orbit excited states follow spin-selection rules and enable optical spin initialization, readout and entanglement.

The NV electronic transition  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$  to  $|-1\rangle$  is split due to interaction with three strongly coupled nuclear spins (hyperfine couplings:  $^{14}\mathrm{N}$ , 2.16 MHz;  $^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}$ , 413 kHz;  $^{13}\mathrm{C}_{2}$ , 89 kHz). e, Left: single-shot readout for strongly coupled nuclear spins (depicted by red box in 'wire diagram'). The protocol consists of repetitions of the following block: the nuclear spin state (here for  $^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}$ ) is correlated to the electron spin state by a controlled-not operation and then the electron state is read-out (green box). Right: fluorescence time traces showing quantum jumps between nuclear spin states. The orange curves are guides to the eye. f, Illustration of hyperfine coupling. If the electron spin is in  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$ , the nuclear spin (labelled 'n') precesses with frequency  $\omega_{0}$  about the applied magnetic field B, while in  $|m_{s} = -1\rangle$ , the nuclear precession frequency  $\omega_{-1}$  and axis are modified by the hyperfine components  $A_{\parallel}$  and  $A_{\perp}$ , which depend on the relative position between the nuclear and electron spin. g, Schematic for the evolution of a nuclear spin when the electron spin is repeatedly flipped by a dynamical decoupling sequence.  $B_{0}$  and  $B_{1}$  are the effective magnetic fields felt by the nuclear spin when the electron spin state  $|\psi_{el}\rangle$  is  $|m_{s} = 0\rangle$  and  $|m_{s} = 1\rangle$ , respectively. When the spacing between the electronic  $\pi$ -pulses is in resonance with a half-period of the nuclear Larmor precession, the nuclear spin effectively rotates in opposite directions depending on the initial electron spin state. h, Data showing oscillations in the  $<Y>$  component of a weakly coupled nuclear spin after a dynamical decoupling sequence. This sequence implements a conditional nuclear rotation gate  $R_{\pm X}^{N\varphi}$ : the initial electron spin state determines the nuclear rotation axis  $(\pm X)$ , while the number of pulses  $N$  determines the total rotation angle  $N\varphi$ .

the electron spin thus modulate the nuclear precession, such that when the unique dynamics of a targeted nuclear spin is in resonance with the periodicity of the DD pulses, the precession due to its transverse hyperfine component accumulates $^{38,40}$  (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, destructive interference occurs for nuclear spins with dynamics

out-of-sync with the DD sequence. Through this method, universal control $^{40}$  and single-shot readout $^{41}$  of weakly coupled nuclear spins were demonstrated (Fig. 1h). These capabilities, together with remote electron entanglement $^{11,42}$ , establish an architecture for distributed quantum communication and computing based on

error-corrected few-qubit nodes. Moreover, the direct applicability of DD methods to sensing nuclear species external to diamond has impacted progress in nanoscale magnetic resonance $^{43,44}$ .

# Emerging systems for spin/light interfaces

Although possessing long spin coherence, NV centres are hindered by their broad emission spectrum, where only  $\sim 4\%$  of the total photons are coherently emitted into the zero-phonon line (ZPL) at  $6\mathrm{K}$  (ref. 45). Since entanglement protocols require indistinguishable photons from remote NVs, this low percentage and the high scattering losses in optical fibre at the ZPL wavelength  $(637~\mathrm{nm})$  have limited entanglement rates to  $40\mathrm{Hz}$  (ref. 20). Achieving higher bandwidth in NV-based quantum networks will thus require photonic cavities to boost ZPL emission[45-48] and, for long-distance networks, quantum frequency conversion into telecom wavelengths[49], together with the advantages of a quantum repeater architecture. Promising for quantum network applications, recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have shown emission into the ZPL with  $46\%$  probability using microcavities[50] and conversion of single NV photons into telecom wavelength with  $17\%$  efficiency using difference frequency generation[51]. A parallel approach that may relax these requirements for efficient long-distance entanglement is the advancement of alternative colour centres with more favourable intrinsic properties.

Silicon-vacancy and germanium-vacancy centres in diamond. The silicon-vacancy (SiV) centre in diamond, consisting of an interstitial silicon atom midway between two adjacent carbon vacancies, has garnered interest as a higher-efficiency source of indistinguishable photons. The negative charge state  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$  features an orbital doublet in both the ground and excited states, with degeneracies broken by the spin-orbit interaction[52,53] (Fig. 2a). Four zero-phonon optical transitions between these orbital levels comprise over  $70\%$  of the total fluorescence emission, with  $\sim 50\%$  into the single line C at  $4\mathrm{K}$  (Fig. 2b). Moreover, due to the defect's inversion symmetry,  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$  optical transitions are robust in linear order to electric-field and strain variations, resulting in highly stable and homogeneous emission frequencies with lifetime-limited linewidths[53].

The  $S = 1/2$  electronic spin of  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$  can be coherently controlled by either microwave or optical driving, where the latter utilizes a GS-ES lambda (Λ) system tuned by an off-axis magnetic field. However, coherent population trapping $^{54,55}$  and Ramsey $^{56}$  experiments indicate a short spin dephasing time  $T_{2}^{*} \sim 100$  ns at  $4\mathrm{K}$ . Phonon-mediated transitions between the two ground-state orbital branches, separated by  $50\mathrm{GHz} \approx 2.5\mathrm{K}$ , represent the dominant contribution to spin dephasing, arising from slightly different spin splitting in each orbital. Recently, by cooling  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$  to  $100\mathrm{mK}$  (refs $^{57,58}$ ), spin coherence was extended to  $T_{2}^{*} \approx 10~\mu \mathrm{s}$  and  $T_{2} \approx 13~\mathrm{ms}$  for an isotopically purified sample $^{58}$ , clearing the way for coherent manipulation of coupled nuclear memories. Additionally, efficient ZPL emission from  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ , predominantly polarized into a single transition dipole, makes this defect attractive for coupling to nanophotonic structures $^{59}$ . Through precision placement of  $\mathrm{Si}^{+}$  ions into a nanophotonic cavity, the entanglement signature between two emitters was observed $^{60}$  (Fig. 2c). Possessing similar spin and optical properties as  $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ , the germanium-vacancy ( $\mathrm{GeV}^{-}$ ) centre in diamond may offer stronger atom-light coupling due to its higher quantum efficiency $^{61,62}$ . Furthermore, the neutral charge state of  $\mathrm{SiV}^{63,64}$  and the tin-vacancy centre $^{65,66}$  have recently been investigated to potentially combine a robust optical interface with long spin coherence at moderate cryogenic temperatures, although optical spin readout for these systems has yet to be demonstrated.

Divacancy and silicon-vacancy in silicon carbide. Silicon carbide (SiC) presents an opportunity to integrate colour centres into a technologically mature platform capable of wafer-scale growth,

fabrication and doping $^{67}$ . Unlike diamond, SiC exists in over 250 polytypes $^{68}$  (different stacking sequences of a silicon-carbon bilayer unit) to allow customizable material properties and heterojunction devices, boosting the potential for interacting its hosted colour centre spins with electrical or mechanical degrees of freedom $^{69,70}$ . Among colour centres investigated in SiC, the divacancy and silicon-vacancy defects have fulfilled key requirements for quantum applications, including optical electron and nuclear spin addressability $^{35,71}$ , long spin coherence $^{72-74}$  and single-defect isolation $^{72,75}$ .

The neutral divacancy  $(\mathrm{V_C - V_{Si}}$  missing C atom next to missing Si atom) possesses the same  $C_{3\nu}$  symmetry and number of active electrons as the NV centre in diamond, leading to analogous spin and optical structures[67] (Fig. 2d). Its spin-triplet ground state exhibits electron coherence times  $T_{2}$  that can exceed 1 ms in samples with natural isotope abundance[72]. This extended coherence despite higher fractions of nuclear spins than diamond stems from the larger lattice spacing in SiC and the suppression of heteronuclear flip-flops between  $^{29}\mathrm{Si}$  and  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  at moderate magnetic fields  $(T_{2} > 1\mathrm{ms}$  for  $B > 15\mathrm{mT})^{76,77}$ . Crucially, divacancies have ZPLs at near-infrared wavelengths  $\sim 1,100\mathrm{nm}$ , where significantly lower attenuation in optical fibre  $\sim 1\mathrm{dBkm^{-1}}$  versus  $\sim 8\mathrm{dBkm^{-1}}$  at  $637~\mathrm{nm}$  for the NV centre in diamond) will facilitate entanglement generation over long distances. Recently, single divacancies, isolated in the 4H and 3C polytypes, were shown to display well-resolved spin-dependent optical transitions below  $20\mathrm{K}$ , similar to the NV centre (Fig. 2e)[78]. Consequently, high-fidelity resonant readout[78] of the divacancy spin (Fig. 2f) and Stark tuning of its optical transition frequencies[79] were demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, establishing critical elements for the implementation of entanglement protocols[11]. Harnessing the advantages of divacancies for long-range quantum networks will also require improving their photon-collection efficiency and natural ZPL emission fraction  $(5 - 7\%)$ [78]. To this end, 3C-SiC, which can be epitaxially grown as thin films on silicon, presents an advanced platform for nanophotonic engineering[80,81].

The negatively charged silicon vacancy  $(\mathrm{V_{Si}})$  single missing Si atom) diverges from the well-studied NV-type level structure due to its odd number of active electrons that gives rise to a  $S = 3 / 2$  ground state and a complex set of optical transitions[82]. Notably, its spin properties and optical readout at room temperature provide unique capabilities for thermometry[83] and vector magnetometry[84]. Single  $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$  at both inequivalent lattice sites (V1 and V2 centres) in 4H-SiC have been isolated, with both centres possessing coherence on the order of milliseconds under dynamical decoupling[73,74] and the V1 centre emitting  $40\%$  of its photons into the ZPL at  $4\mathrm{K}$  (ref. [74]) (Fig. 2d,g). A crucial step will be the demonstration of the predicted excited-state fine structure[82] that enables schemes for spin-photon entanglement.

Rare-earth ions in solids. Owing to shielding provided by their filled outer electronic shells, rare-earth ions in solid-state crystals possess  $4f$  electrons with optical and spin levels that display narrow intrinsic linewidths and high spectral stability, reminiscent of free atoms. This isolation from environmental noise has been exploited in rare-earth ensembles for photonic quantum memories, where the quantum state of single photons is stored and retrieved via the collective optical and spin-wave excitations of the ensemble $^{3,85}$ . Moreover, rare-earth impurities provide exceptionally long-lived nuclear spins with relaxation and coherence times measured in units of days $^{86}$  and hours $^{87}$ , respectively. While these properties motivate rare-earth ensemble systems as leading platforms for quantum repeaters and transducers $^{88,89}$ , extending control to single rare-earth ions would expand capabilities for programmable quantum circuits.

Recently, several groups have optically addressed single rare-earth ions, overcoming challenges in signal-to-noise ratios due to their weak optical emission and high background fluorescence in low-purity samples. These groups implemented techniques such

Additionally, the hyperfine levels of single  $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$  ions in yttrium orthosilicate  $(\mathrm{YSO})^{90,91}$ ,  $\mathrm{LaF}_3$  (ref.  ${}^{92}$ ) and  $\mathrm{YAG}^{95}$  were spectroscopically resolved, allowing nuclear spins to be initialized and read-out by resonant optical excitation and manipulated by radiofrequency fields (Fig. 3a,b). Coherence of single nuclear spins in  $\mathrm{Pr:YAG}$  was limited at  $4\mathrm{K}$  by electron-phonon coupling $^{95}$  ( $T_{\ln} \sim 4~\mu\mathrm{s}$ ), but can exceed seconds for  $\mathrm{Pr:YSO}$  based on ensemble measurements $^{96}$ . Notably, an alternative detection route for single rare-earth ions relies on charge sensing of resonant photoionization, demonstrated for single  $\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  ions in a silicon single-electron transistor $^{97}$ .

The robustness of rare-earth systems to surface perturbations motivates nanophotonic engineering as a promising route to ameliorate their low photon count rate. Recently, an atomic frequency comb quantum memory with optical control over the storage time was demonstrated for a small ensemble of  $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$  ions in a nanophotonic cavity[98]. Moreover, several groups reported addressing single rare-earth ions, exploiting cavity enhancement of their spontaneous emission rate (Purcell factors  $>100$ [99,100]. Cavities can be fabricated directly into glassy rare-earth host materials by focused ion beam milling[98,99]. Additionally, they can be fabricated externally into a material, such as silicon, and then transferred onto the rare-earth

host for evanescent coupling<sup>100</sup>. These platforms set the stage for advances in optical control and remote entanglement of rare-earth electrons and nuclei, as well as quantum routing of single photons, in integrated photonic devices.

Optically active donors in silicon. The miniaturization of silicon electronics to the nanoscale has naturally broached the prospect for quantum systems in this technologically ubiquitous platform. In recent years, the electron and nuclear spins of single  $^{31}\mathrm{P}$  donors in silicon have been read-out by spin-dependent tunnelling in a single-electron transistor, demonstrating state-of-the-art coherence times  $(T_{2e} > 0.5$  s at  $100\mathrm{mK}$ ) and control fidelities ( $>99.99\%$  for a single  $^{31}\mathrm{P}$  nuclear spin) $^{101}$ . However, coupling between multiple donor qubits in silicon remains an unsolved challenge, motivating various proposals that span nanometre $^{1}$  to macroscopic length scales $^{102,103}$ . Schemes requiring strong coupling of individual donor spins to a common microwave resonator $^{102}$  are difficult to realize due to their small magnetic dipole moment. Recently, strong coupling between microwave cavity photons and a single electron spin in a silicon double quantum dot was achieved only after hybridizing the spin with its electronic wavefunction in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field $^{104,105}$ . Alternatively, optical photon interconnects $^{103}$  could realize longer-distance couplings.

For group V shallow donors, optical transitions to excited orbital states occur in the far-infrared, a technologically difficult regime.

Instead, efforts have focused on transitions between the neutral donor  $(\mathrm{D}^0)$  and its donor-bound exciton  $(\mathrm{D}^0\mathrm{X})$  with energies at  $1.15\mathrm{eV}$ , near bandgap. In isotopically enriched  ${}^{28}\mathrm{Si}$  samples, these transitions are sufficiently narrow to resolve the hyperfine structure of  ${}^{31}\mathrm{P}$  donors, allowing optical pumping through an Auger deexcitation to hyperpolarize the electron and nuclear spin[106,107]. This Auger decay occurs with near-unit probability in indirect-bandgap Si and enables electrical readout of long-lasting nuclear spin coherence that exceeds 39 min at room temperature for ensembles of ionized donors[106,107]. However, the non-radiative nature of this process precludes optical detection or coupling of single donors.

Recently, singly ionized, chalcogen double donors (for example,  $\mathrm{S}^+$ ,  $\mathrm{Se}^+$ ) have begun to be investigated for their stronger binding energies ( $\sim 600\mathrm{mV}/2.9\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) that permit donor optical transitions in the mid-infrared[103] (Fig. 3c). Optical measurements on  $^{77}\mathrm{Se}^+$  ensembles at  $1.2\mathrm{K}$  demonstrate competitive electron spin coherence times ( $T_{2,\mathrm{Hahn}} = 2\mathrm{s}$  for a qubit based on a clock transition) and hyperfine-resolved optical transitions with narrow homogeneous linewidths ( $< 29\mathrm{MHz}$ ). Isolation of single chalcogen donors in the future could enable the use of silicon-on-insulator photonics for cavity-enhanced readout and coupling[103].

# Applications of quantum registers and memories

In this section, we highlight recent advances that leverage the collective functionality of electron and nuclear spins in solid-state defect systems for quantum applications.

Quantum networks. Shared entanglement between spatially separated nodes in a quantum network represents the essential resource for quantum key distribution and quantum cloud computing, possessing security independent of the trustworthiness of the communicating devices $^{108}$  or computing server $^{109}$ . Although photons are ideal long-distance carriers of quantum states, their conversion to long-lived stationary qubits is necessary for flexible timing of network tasks and efficient propagation of entanglement over long distances $^{4}$ . These requirements are fulfilled by the NV centre in diamond, which combines a spin/light interface with control over local nuclear memories. In 2013, a breakthrough experiment established entanglement between two NV spins separated by  $3\mathrm{m}$  (ref.  ${}^{11}$ ). Using the Barrett-Kok protocol, each NV centre was prepared to allow probabilistic emission of a photon correlated with its spin state. If the NV centres emit indistinguishable photons (requiring the ZPL), overlapping their emitted modes on a beam-splitter erases which-path information and causes detection of a single photon to project

the NV centres into an entangled state. Owing to possible photon loss, detection of a second single photon in an ensuing trial where both NV spins are flipped is required to confirm the entangled state, leading to a low success probability  $P_{\mathrm{E}} \approx 10^{-7}$ , proportional to the square of the photon-collection efficiency. Nevertheless, the high fidelity of the heralded entangled state ( $\sim 0.92$ ), as well as its fast tomography by single-shot readout, enabled the first loophole-free Bell test, using two NV centres separated by  $1.3 \, \mathrm{km}$  (ref. 110) (Fig. 4a,b).

Incorporating nuclear memories with remote electron entanglement enables key network primitives, such as teleportation, entanglement purification and photonic quantum memory. The state of the nitrogen nuclear spin associated with one NV centre of an entangled pair was unconditionally teleported (that is, each attempt is successful) onto the electron spin of the other NV centre<sup>111</sup>. Recently, entanglement purification, an essential capability of quantum repeaters that 'distills' a single high-fidelity entangled state from multiple lower-fidelity copies, was achieved<sup>112</sup> (Fig. 4c,d). Here, a low-quality entangled state is first generated between two NV spins by detecting only a single output photon at the beam-splitter, forgiving the second trial of the Barrett-Kok protocol<sup>11,110</sup>. The entangled electron states are then swapped onto  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  nuclear spins at both nodes, freeing the communication qubits for additional entanglement generation. Critically, the weakly coupled nuclear memories used are robust to several hundred optical cycles of the electron<sup>37</sup>, allowing the second entanglement generation to be attempted until success. The memory qubits are finally projected onto a pure entangled state depending on the outcome of local operations on the two entangled pairs<sup>112</sup>. Since the purification protocol does not require simultaneous detection of single photons in two consecutive entanglement attempts, it achieves faster entanglement rates that scale linearly in photon detection probability.

While the above applications leverage the emission of spin-entangled photons, the optical interface of the NV centre additionally permits quantum storage of incident photons and absorption-based remote entanglement $^{113}$ . Raman quantum memories for photons similar to those for rare-earth and atomic systems were proposed for ensembles of NV centres $^{114,115}$ , but have been difficult to realize due to the crowded NV excited-state structure and larger optical inhomogeneous broadening. Alternatively, using a single NV centre, photon polarization states were coherently transferred onto the intrinsic nitrogen nuclear spin $^{113}$  (Fig. 4e,f). This recent demonstration prepares the electron and nitrogen nuclear spins in an entangled Bell state, and then utilizes the entangled absorption of

In this case, the entangled absorption of a resonant photon transfers the photon polarization onto the phase of the nuclear superposition state. Successful absorption is heralded by single-shot spin readout. f, Data showing the faithful mapping of the photon polarization onto the nuclear superposition state.

a photon in a degenerate optical  $\Lambda$  system<sup>116</sup> to teleport the photon polarization onto the nuclear spin. This approach paves the way for entanglement distribution between network nodes through the absorption of entangled photon pairs at the NV resonant energy.

Quantum computing. Overcoming the challenge of scaling a quantum computer to the large number of qubits required to outperform classical algorithms hinges on correcting the inevitable errors that arise due to the delicate, analogue nature of quantum states. While a potential resolution lies in a monolithic architecture employing a large qubit array stabilized by topological codes, a distributed or modular architecture that utilizes photonically linked nodes, each with only a small number of qubits, could provide efficiencies due to its reconfigurable connections and non-local quantum gates[117]. This distributed architecture is particularly applicable to defect-based quantum registers of electron and nuclear spins, which satisfy the requirements for inter-node photonic entanglement, as

well as intra-node universal control and non-demolition readout. Encouragingly, a distributed error-correction approach using only four qubits per node was shown to possess modest threshold error rates for the entangling links ( $\sim 10\%$ ) and local operations ( $\sim 1\%$ ) that would allow a large-scale implementation to be fault-tolerant<sup>118</sup>.

Experimental efforts have so far focused on error correction within individual nodes. In 2014, two groups $^{30,40}$  demonstrated a majority-vote error-correction protocol, encoding a quantum bit in a logical qubit of three spins (Fig. 4g). These experiments leveraged advanced electron-nuclear initialization sequences and quantum gates to correct a single bit-flip error automatically during the decoding of the three-qubit register, avoiding direct measurement of error syndromes. More recently, by utilizing non-demolition, single-shot readout at cryogenic temperatures, a stabilizer-based approach $^{119}$  involving active error detection and real-time feedback was implemented for a logical qubit of three weakly coupled  $^{13}\mathrm{C}$  nuclei. This latter experiment demonstrated a continuously

phase-corrected logical qubit with coherence exceeding its best component qubit. Future prospects include extending error correction to larger qubit registers and applying more sophisticated codes to repair arbitrary single-qubit errors, or combining it with remote electron entanglement for networked information processing. In addition, the potential to coherently interface shallow NV centres with chemically assembled nuclear spin arrays on the surface of diamond could enable large-scale quantum simulations $^{120}$ . Towards simulations of quantum chemistry and condensed-matter phases, proof-of-principle demonstrations with NV quantum registers internal to diamond have deduced the energy structure of a  $\mathrm{HeH^{+}}$  cation $^{121}$  and a topological wire coupled to a superconductor $^{122}$ .

Quantum sensing. The atomic-scale dimensions, fast dynamics and acute sensitivity of quantum systems make them exceptional probes of their environment, combining high spatial resolution, bandwidth and precision. The challenge of quantum sensing is to isolate maximum information about a target variable from its effect on the dynamics of the quantum sensor, which simultaneously experiences decoherence and a multitude of competing influences<sup>6</sup>. The room-temperature coherence of NV centres and their diverse deployment inside wide-field arrays<sup>123</sup>, nanoparticles<sup>124</sup> and scanning probes<sup>125-127</sup> have precipitated their development as a transformative technology for sensing magnetic fields and other external perturbations (Fig. 5a-d). Wide-ranging efforts have leveraged the NV sensor for detection and characterization of intracellular and

biological processes $^{123,124,128}$ , nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) $^{43,44,129,130}$ , magnetism in condensed-matter systems $^{125-127,131}$  and device performance of nanotechnologies $^{132,133}$ .

In particular, NV detection of NMR spectroscopy significantly enhances the sensitivity and spatial resolution of this powerful technique, promising chemical structure identification with single-molecule sensitivity and subcellular resolution (Fig. 5e,f). However, improving the frequency resolution of NV detection to distinguish the few-hertz changes in NMR frequencies due to chemical shifts and spin-spin couplings represents an ongoing pursuit. Pioneering works applied DD sequences to single shallow NV centres to sense the magnetic field fluctuations from a statistical polarization of  $\sim 10^2$  external protons[43,44]. These experiments demonstrated  $\sim 10$  kHz NMR linewidths, limited by  $T_{2}$  of the NV sensor and diffusion of the target nuclei through the nanoscale sensing volume. Correlation spectroscopy extends the phase acquisition time to the electron  $T_{1}$  ( $\sim$ ms), improving spectral resolution to several hundred hertz[134,135]. Here, the phase accumulated during an initial DD segment is stored in the polarization of the electron spin and then correlated to the phase from a second DD segment after free evolution of the target nuclei.

Recently, the intrinsic nitrogen nuclear spin was leveraged as a longer-term memory for the initial phase measured in correlation spectroscopy, extending the interrogation time to  $T_{\mathrm{ln}}$  ( $>$  minutes for Tesla-scale magnetic fields) $^{136-138}$ . This approach naturally integrates repetitive, non-demolition nuclear state readout $^{31,130}$  and

also frees the sensor electron spin so that its back-action on the target nuclei, which shortens their correlation time, can be decoupled $^{137}$ . Although sample diffusion still limited the sensing duration ( $\sim 5$  ms), the nuclear memory approach resolved part-per-million-level chemical shifts in liquid-state samples $^{139}$  (Fig. 5f). Alternatively, a recent NMR scheme $^{140}$  utilized an NV ensemble and a synchronous readout technique $^{141,142}$  that enabled frequency resolution independent of the sensor coherence time. Here, the larger sensing volume mitigated the effects of diffusion and enabled access to the thermal, rather than statistical, nuclear polarization, culminating in  $\sim 3$  Hz spectral resolution to resolve chemical shifts and nuclear spin-spin couplings $^{140}$ .

# Challenges and outlook

Even with the enormous progress in impurity systems, the potential for improvement across the spectrum of applications is limitless. Realizing kilohertz entanglement rates across metropolitan distances, distributed logical qubits in a fault-tolerant network, or real-time intracellular NMR spectroscopy, among other far-reaching goals, will require concerted advances in photonic and device engineering, quantum control and materials science. Moreover, while it may be enticing to regard solid-state spins as a self-sufficient platform, exploration of their connection to diverse quantum systems may lead to hybrid devices with optimized components. Recent advances in interacting NV spins with microwave $^{143}$ , acoustic $^{144,145}$ , or magnonic excitations $^{146,147}$  open new routes towards on-chip state transfer and entanglement between impurity spins or hybrid systems.

While the solid-state environment poses challenges to impurity spins via phonon broadening and total internal reflection of their emission, it also provides them their greatest asset, amenability to fabrication and device integration. Coupling of optical emitters to photonic cavities with high quality factors and small mode volumes concentrates their emission into the ZPL and into a single cavity mode for efficient collection. A recent Fabry-Pérot microcavity design[50] directs  $46\%$  of the NV centre's emission into the ZPL, offering in situ resonance tuning and reduced processing-induced broadening of NV linewidths as advantages over previous monolithic diamond approaches[46] (Fig. 6a). In parallel, novel defect platforms with robust  $\mathrm{ZPLs}^{60}$  or advanced heteroepitaxy and selective etching techniques[78] will accelerate photonic cavity development (Fig. 6b). These advances will enable significantly higher rates of indistinguishable photons for long-distance entanglement, as well as ultimately near-deterministic light-matter interactions in the strong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Towards continental-scale fibre-based quantum networks, defect systems with near-telecom wavelength emission, such as divacancies in SiC or various rare-earth ions, may offer additional avenues to create efficient entanglement between solid-state nodes.

At a more local level, a promising direction lies in integrating impurity spins with on-chip photonics, thereby creating field-deployable quantum sensors and compact information processing devices. An integrated package using microfabricated photonic elements, including waveguides, couplers, metalenses and superconducting nanowire detectors, could crucially reduce optical losses and eliminate bulky free-space optics $^{48,148,149}$  (Fig. 6c). In these integrated photonic circuits, impurity spins would provide powerful functionalities as single-photon sources, photonic memories and nonlinear single-photon switches, establishing a scalable architecture for quantum processors based on either photonic or modular matter-based qubits. Moreover, engineering of lab-on-a-chip devices $^{150}$  and deployable probes, such as nanodiamonds attached directly to optical fibres $^{151}$ , will proliferate the reach of quantum sensing. For example, diamond devices with surface-structured microfluidic grooves realize both enhanced sensor-analyte contact for NMR applications and increased photon-collection efficiency by optical waveguiding $^{152}$ .

Advances in quantum control and materials science will naturally be fundamental to continued progress. Encoding quantum memories in decoherence-free subspaces of two nuclear spins would allow the use of more strongly coupled nuclear spins while maintaining robustness to optical excitation[37]. This would increase speeds for interfacing quantum memories and enable high-throughput multiplexed versions of entanglement protocols, where entanglement is continuously attempted using multiple memories before successes are heralded[153]. Time-dependent Hamiltonian engineering, such as optimal control[154] and shortcuts to adiabacity[155], could be extended for fast and robust gates despite densely spaced electron-nuclear energy levels. Furthermore, the convergence of quantum error correction and quantum sensing could improve sensitivity by extending qubit coherence regardless of the noise spectrum, in contrast to dynamical decoupling. Pioneering demonstrations[156,157] leveraged a single ancilla nuclear spin that is robust against noise to correct the NV electron sensor. Finally, improvements in materials engineering could overcome current limits to many applications, as well as open new opportunities. Important challenges include the creation of high-density near-surface defect centres with long coherence times and a single orientation[158-160], control over defect charge states by Fermi level tuning, and customized surface functionalization for targeted sensing tasks. In addition, the discovery of novel impurity

systems with superlative optical, spin and host material properties may aid in bringing solid-state spins closer to widely impactful quantum technologies.
