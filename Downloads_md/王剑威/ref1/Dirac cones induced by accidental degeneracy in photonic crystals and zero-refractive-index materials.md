A zero-refractive-index metamaterial is one in which waves do not experience any spatial phase change, and such a peculiar material has many interesting wave-manipulating properties $^{1-10}$ . These materials can in principle be realized using man-made composites comprising metallic resonators $^{7}$  or chiral inclusions $^{11,12}$ , but metallic components have losses that compromise functionality at high frequencies. It would be highly desirable if we could achieve a zero refractive index using dielectrics alone. Here, we show that by employing accidental degeneracy, dielectric photonic crystals can be designed and fabricated that exhibit Dirac cone dispersion at the centre of the Brillouin zone at a finite frequency. In addition to many interesting properties intrinsic to a Dirac cone dispersion $^{13-19}$ , we can use effective medium theory to relate the photonic crystal to a material with effectively zero permittivity and permeability. We then numerically and experimentally demonstrate in the microwave regime that such dielectric photonic crystals with reasonable dielectric constants manipulate waves as if they had near-zero refractive indices at and near the Dirac point frequency.

Electronic $^{13-15}$  and photonic systems $^{16-23}$  with Dirac cones in the band structure possess remarkable wave transport properties $^{13-19}$ . Materials with a zero refractive index also possess very interesting wave manipulation characteristics $^{1-10}$ . These two seemingly unrelated classes of material are actually related in a subtle way. For a dispersive homogeneous material in which the frequency-dependent permittivity  $(\varepsilon)$  and permeability  $(\mu)$  are simultaneously zero at a particular frequency  $\omega_0$ , it can be shown that the dispersion is linear and cone-like at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  at  $\omega_0$  (ref. 16). As  $\varepsilon(\omega) = \mu(\omega) = 0$  implies an effectively zero refractive index, there is an intimate relationship between zero refractive index and Dirac cone dispersion. However, a Dirac cone dispersion does not necessarily imply a zero refractive index. Although it is well known that some photonic crystals (PCs) have Dirac cone dispersion $^{17-23}$ , the Dirac points are at the zone boundary, and these cannot be mapped to a zero-refractive-index system. A Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  is required, which is difficult to realize because the dispersions are generally quadratic at the centre of the Brillouin zone, making a linear dispersion at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  (a necessary condition for a Dirac cone) the exception rather than the rule. In addition, even if we can design a PC with a Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$ , it can be mapped to an  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}} = \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = 0$  system only if an effective medium theory $^{24}$  can be satisfactorily applied.

The purpose of this work is to establish the conditions for realizing Dirac cones at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  in dielectric PCs. We propose to show by numerical simulations and through microwave experiments that

an effective medium theory can indeed link such 'Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  PCs with reasonable dielectric constants to a  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}} = \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = 0$  system, and that purely dielectric PCs can behave as if they had a zero refractive index.

Figure 1a shows that linear dispersion and Dirac cones can be obtained at the  $\Gamma$  point  $(\mathbf{k} = 0)$  using a simple two-dimensional (2D) PC consisting of a square lattice of dielectric rods. The band structures are calculated for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization with the electric field along the rod axis. Here, the

lattice constant and the speed of light are denoted by  $a$  and  $c$ , and the radius and relative permittivity of the cylinders are set at  $R = 0.2a$  and  $\varepsilon = 12.5$ , respectively. Two branches with linear dispersion intersect at a triply-degenerate point at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  (with frequency  $f = 0.541c / a$ ), forming a Dirac cone. There is an additional flat branch intersecting the Dirac point. That flat band corresponds to a dipolar mode with its magnetic field polarized parallel to the wave vector  $\mathbf{k}$  near  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  (see the Supplementary Information). Thus it is a magnetic longitudinal mode near the  $\Gamma$  point. The Dirac cone modes comprise a dipolar mode with its magnetic field polarized perpendicular to  $\mathbf{k}$  and a monopolar mode. A Dirac cone at the  $\Gamma$  point can also be found in a PC with a triangular lattice, as shown in the Supplementary Information. To illustrate such Dirac cones visually, the dispersion surfaces for the square lattice are plotted in Fig. 1b and for the triangular lattice in the Supplementary Information. There are clearly Dirac cones at the  $\Gamma$  point (purple) and a flat sheet (green) crossing the Dirac point.

The Dirac cones at the K point in electronic graphene $^{13-15}$  and in PCs (refs 17-23) with a triangular lattice that have been studied previously are consequences of the lattice symmetry. However, lattice symmetry alone gives only zero group velocity and hence quadratic dispersion at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$ . A Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  requires linear dispersion, which can be induced by accidental degeneracy. The condition for the existence of an 'accidental-degeneracy-induced

Dirac point' (ADIDP) can be established using multiple scattering theory (MST). For the system under consideration, it is sufficient (see Supplementary Information) to consider dipolar  $(m = \pm 1)$  and monopolar  $(m = 0)$  terms, where  $m$  is the angular momentum number. The MST equations can be written in matrix form as:

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c c c} S _ {0} - 1 / D _ {- 1} & - S _ {1} & S _ {2} \\ - S _ {- 1} & S _ {0} - 1 / D _ {0} & - S _ {1} \\ S _ {- 2} & - S _ {- 1} & S _ {0} - 1 / D _ {1} \end{array} \right) \cdot \left( \begin{array}{l} b _ {- 1} \\ b _ {0} \\ b _ {1} \end{array} \right) = 0 \tag {1}
$$

where  $D_{\mathrm{m}}$  and  $b_{\mathrm{m}}$  are the  $T$ -matrix and Mie scattering coefficients respectively and  $S_{\mathrm{m}}$  denotes the lattice sum with  $S_{-\mathrm{m}} = -S_{\mathrm{m}}^{*}$ . The cylindrical symmetry of the cylinders ensures that  $D_{1} = D_{-1}$ , and lattice symmetry requires that  $S_{\pm 1} = S_{\pm 2} = 0$  at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  for the square lattice. Solving equation (1) yields a monopolar eigenstate at frequency  $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ , where  $S_0 - 1 / D_0 = 0$ , and doubly-degenerate dipolar eigenstates at a different frequency  $\omega_{\mathrm{d}}$ , where  $S_0 - 1 / D_{\pm 1} = 0$ .

The dispersion near  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  can be obtained by using perturbation methods (Supplementary Information). In general,  $D_0 \neq D_{\pm 1}$  and the dispersion will have three branches, one branch corresponding to monopolar modes and two dipolar branches, all the branches with quadratic dispersion. If, however, there is accidental degeneracy such that  $\omega_{\mathrm{m}} = \omega_{\mathrm{d}} = \omega^{*}$ , or equivalently  $S_0 = 1 / D_0 = 1 / D_{\pm 1}$ , the dispersion near  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  changes such that one solution has dispersion  $\omega_{1} - \omega^{*} = 0 + O(\delta k^{2})$ , corresponding

to a band of quadratic dispersion that is almost flat near the  $\Gamma$  point, and two solutions that have a leading linear term of the form  $\omega_{2,3} - \omega^{*} = \pm \nu_{\mathrm{g}}\delta k + O(\delta k^2)$ , corresponding to linear bands with opposite and non-zero group velocities  $\pm \nu_{\mathrm{g}}$ . This, therefore, establishes theoretically that Dirac-like linear dispersion can be induced by accidental degeneracy. For a given value of permittivity and a given lattice constant, the condition  $S_0 = 1 / D_0 = 1 / D_{\pm 1}$  can be achieved at a specific rod radius, and the resulting degeneracy is 'accidental', as is not a consequence of symmetry.

Figure 2a shows the calculated values of the imaginary part of  $S_0 - 1 / D_0$  and  $S_0 - 1 / D_1$  (here  $S_0 - 1 / D_0$  and  $S_0 - 1 / D_1$  are purely imaginary numbers, see Supplementary Information) as a function of frequency for the parameters shown in Fig. 1a. Clearly the condition  $S_0 = 1 / D_0 = 1 / D_{\pm 1}$  is indeed satisfied at the Dirac point frequency  $f = 0.541c / a$ , and hence  $S_0 = 1 / D_0 = 1 / D_{\pm 1}$  is the 'design condition' to obtain a Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  for PCs composed of cylindrical rods.

Is it possible, then, to describe the physics of the Dirac cone with an effective medium theory, and if so, what would it be? Note that an effective medium description would obviously be difficult for Dirac cones at the zone boundaries $^{17-23}$ , but as the Dirac cones in this system are located at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$ , an effective medium description should be possible if the Dirac point is at a low enough frequency, which can always be achieved by using a material with a high enough dielectric constant. The question is how far this can be pushed using reasonable values of  $\varepsilon$ . To answer that question, we applied effective medium theory $^{24}$  to calculate the effective medium parameters for the structure shown in Fig. 1 with dielectric cylinders with  $\varepsilon = 12.5$ . The effective permittivity  $(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}})$  and permeability  $(\mu_{\mathrm{eff}})$  as a function of frequency are shown in Fig. 2b, and  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}$  and  $\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$  indeed intersect at zero at the Dirac point. In addition, Fig. 2a shows that the frequency at which  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}} = \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = 0(\omega a / 2\pi c = 0.541)$  is precisely the accidental degeneracy frequency defined by  $S_0 = 1 / D_0 = 1 / D_{\pm 1}$ . So, if the effective medium theory is a good description, a PC with a Dirac cone at the  $\Gamma$  point is an effective zero-refractive-index material with  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}} = \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = 0$  at the Dirac point. Since  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}$  and  $\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$  approach zero simultaneously and linearly, the effective impedance of such a PC is a finite constant and the group velocity is also non-zero there. In addition, the PC system involves dielectrics alone and therefore will be low loss, which is an advantage at optical frequencies. We note that nano-scale dielectric (for example Si) pillar arrays can be fabricated $^{25}$ .

PCs have some interesting wave manipulation properties at frequencies near the Dirac point. When a homogeneous zero-index material fills a waveguide, waves can tunnel through channels with unusual shapes<sup>1</sup>. Can a PC with the band structure shown in Fig. 1 support the same behaviour? Figure 3a shows numerical simulations which demonstrate that at the Dirac point frequency, waves incident from the lower left channel can turn round a  $90^{\circ}$  bend and emerge through the upper right exit channel with little distortion. The channels have boundary walls that are perfect magnetic conductors (PMCs). It is also known that an embedded object with PMC boundaries is invisible inside an  $n = 0$  channel<sup>9</sup>. Figure 3b shows that if an object with PMC boundary conditions is inserted into the channel, the wave passes through the channel as if the obstacle were not there, manifesting the cloaking effect.

Figure 4 illustrates an experimental demonstration of the waveguiding properties of the PC. The square lattice PC was made of alumina rods  $3.75\mathrm{mm}$  in radius and the lattice constant was  $17\mathrm{mm}$ . Instead of  $\varepsilon = 12.5$ , as in Figs 1 and 3, alumina rods with  $\varepsilon = 8.8$  were chosen, as these were readily available to us. The corresponding Dirac point frequency is  $10.3\mathrm{GHz}$ . According to the effective medium formulae[24], the corresponding effective permittivity and permeability should still be simultaneously zero at the Dirac point (Fig. 2c). A cutaway view of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 4a (see Methods). Figure 4b shows the measured

field distribution with microwaves incident from the left impinging on the PC (dielectric rods marked in yellow) with the central region replaced by a fairly large  $40\mathrm{mm} \times 40\mathrm{mm}$  metal obstacle (blue coloured square). As the walls were lined with a high-impedance surface[26] (see Methods), the incident wave had a plane wavefront.

The measured fields on the right-hand side of the PC show that the microwaves simply passed through the PC, preserving their plane wave character as if the metal block were not there. Figure 4c shows that if the PC surrounding the metal block is removed, the metal obstacle will cast a clear shadow on the exit side and the plane wavefront is destroyed. Comparing Fig. 4b and c shows that such a PC at the Dirac point frequency can guide waves around an obstacle inside a channel. This also corroborates the recent result[27,28] that transmission through a zero-index metamaterial can be tuned by the details of the embedded defect.

an embedded metal block (blue coloured square). Figure 4d shows that if the embedded metal is in direct contact with the  $\varepsilon = \mu = 0$  medium there is perfect reflection. In Fig. 4e, the simulation result shows that there is almost perfect transmission if there is a thin layer of air (the region between the orange boundary and the blue square) separating the metal block and the  $\varepsilon = \mu = 0$  domain. The experimental results actually correspond to the situation shown in Fig. 4e. One signature property of a zero-index material is that a wave can pass through it with no change in phase. This peculiar property is illustrated in the numerical simulation shown in Fig. 5a, which shows the focusing property of a concave lens made of a homogeneous  $\varepsilon = \mu = 0$  medium. A plane wave is incident from the left, and as there is no phase change across the medium, the phase is the same on the concave surface, leading to the formation of a focal point to the right of the lens. In Fig. 5b the homogeneous medium is replaced by a 2D PC with the configuration and band structure shown in Fig. 1. At the Dirac point frequency there is also a focal point to the right, and the field pattern is similar to the homogeneous case. Figure 5c shows numerical simulations near the Dirac point frequency for a PC with an ADIDP in which the dielectric cylinders are alumina with  $\varepsilon = 8.8$ . The focusing effect is still evident.

Microwave experiments were performed to demonstrate the focusing effect shown in Fig. 5c, the measured field patterns of which are shown in Fig. 5d. Note that both the simulations and the experiments employed absorbing boundaries and the sample size in the experiments was the same as in the simulation. Due

to the size limitations of our translation stage, field patterns could be measured only in the region marked by the dashed lines in Fig. 5c. The reasonable agreement between the simulation results (Fig. 5c) and the experimental observations (Fig. 5d) provide evidence that zero phase change can indeed be achieved with a Dirac cone medium.

In summary, this study has established the conditions for obtaining a Dirac cone at  $\mathbf{k} = 0$  in a dielectric PC. The results suggest that such PCs can be used to realize zero-refractive-index materials using non-metallic elements. The results also highlight yet another interesting implication of having a Dirac cone in the band structure.

# Methods

Theory and simulation. The band structure results shown in Fig. 1a were calculated using the multiple scattering theory (MST), which has been used extensively in previous studies of two-dimensional photonic crystals (see for example ref. 29). The effective medium results were calculated using an MST-based effective medium theory, following the method detailed in ref. 24. The numerical simulation results shown in Figs 3, 4d,e and 5a-c were prepared using the numerical solver 'COMSOL Multiphysics'.

Fabrication of high-impedance surfaces. High-impedance surface boundary walls were employed in the experiment shown in Fig. 4. Such surfaces are widely used as a reflection ground plane for low-profile antennas $^{26}$ . By incorporating surface texture on the top surface, the reflection phase of the high-impedance surface can be tuned to be zero at the design frequency. As for this particular zero-reflection phase for an electric field parallel to the surface, the high-impedance surface served as an artificial perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary at which the electric field parallel to the boundary reflects in-phase. The high-impedance surface was fabricated using double-sided photo-resist FR4 printed circuit board with a thickness of  $1.6\mathrm{mm}$  and  $35\mu \mathrm{m}$  of copper on both sides. One side was covered with an array of  $3.1\mathrm{mm} \times 3.1\mathrm{mm}$  copper patches with a periodicity of  $4\mathrm{mm}$ , and the other side of the board was covered by a continuous copper layer. The zero-reflection frequency was designed to be at the Dirac point frequency of the alumina rod PC,  $10.3\mathrm{GHz}$ . The bandwidth of operation was  $1\mathrm{GHz}$ , defined as the frequency range where the reflection phase varied between  $-90^{\circ}$  and  $90^{\circ}$ . The length of the high-impedance surface was  $450\mathrm{mm}$  in the  $x$  direction (Fig. 4a) for the whole parallel-plate waveguide, and the height (along the  $z$  direction) was  $16\mathrm{mm}$ .

Experimental set-up. A PC consisting of a  $13 \times 11$  array of alumina rods (Fig. 4a) was assembled in the  $xy$  plane in a parallel-plate waveguide composed of two flat metallic (aluminium) plates separated by  $16\mathrm{mm}$ . The PC array was fixed to the lower metal plate. Microwaves were introduced through a double-ridged microwave horn. The boundaries perpendicular to the wave propagation direction ( $x$  direction) were high-impedance surfaces, serving as artificial PMC boundaries. The whole experimental chamber can be considered as a waveguide that supports transverse electromagnetic modes.

As shown in Fig. 4b, in the centre of the PC, a  $3 \times 3$  section of the alumina rods was replaced by a  $40\mathrm{mm} \times 40\mathrm{mm}$  metallic block. A field-scanning antenna was fixed in a hole in the upper metal plate, and the whole upper metal plate and the antenna were mounted on an orthogonal linear translation stage so that the relative position of the antenna with respect to the PC could be translated in the  $xy$  plane. By stepping the upper plate and antenna in  $1\mathrm{mm} \times 1\mathrm{mm}$  increments in the  $xy$  plane, the field amplitude and phase could be recorded outside the PC in both the incident and transmitted regions. This experimental set-up could not measure the field distribution inside the PC. For the control experiment shown in Fig. 4c, the set-up was identical except that all the alumina rods were removed. In Fig. 4b,c, the metal obstacle is indicated (to scale) by a blue square, and the dielectric cylinders are indicated by yellow circles. The air region inside the PC, which could not be measured, is in white.

For the experimental results shown in Fig. 5d, a PC composed of a  $14 \times 24$  array of alumina rods was assembled inside a larger parallel-plate waveguide with the high-impedance surface replaced by absorbing material. Some rods were removed to create a concave surface at the exit end to demonstrate the 'zero phase change' property.
