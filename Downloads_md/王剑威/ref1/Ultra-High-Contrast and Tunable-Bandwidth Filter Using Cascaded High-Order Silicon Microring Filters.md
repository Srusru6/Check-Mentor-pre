We report an experimental measurement of a record  $100\mathrm{dB}$  pass-band to stop-band contrast, tunable  $12 - 125\mathrm{GHz}$  passband full-width at half-maximum, band-center insertion loss ripple  $< 3$  dB, and a group delay ripple  $< 5$  ps, using transverse electric polarized light.

# I. INTRODUCTION

IN LIGHTWAVE communications systems, many of which are based on some form of spectral multiplexing, a compact filter is widely used in wavelength division multiplexing and add/drop functions [1]–[3], channel routing and switching [4]–[6], optical signal processing [7], [8], energy-efficient optical networks [9], etc. Chip-scale silicon photonic circuits enable significant size, weight and energy savings. However, at the high end of the scale, the performance of silicon photonic filters has lagged behind their off-chip counterparts; measurements report (see Table I) about 30-50 dB contrast compared to greater than 60 dB contrast which is available in off-chip systems such as diffractive grating spectrometers, cascaded fiber Bragg grating filters or tabletop diffraction-based instruments. High contrast is particularly useful in LIDAR, nonlinear wavelength conversion, nonlinear microscopy, astronomical optics, and quantum photonics.

Here, we present experimental insertion loss (IL) and group delay (GD) measurements of compact and cascadable silicon microring filters, as shown in Fig. 1, which achieve record  $100\mathrm{dB}$  contrast (two cascaded 5-ring sections) in the drop port for a single (transverse-electric, TE) polarization, as conventionally used in microrings based on rectangular cross-section nanophotonic silicon wire waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate electrical current driven thermooptic tuning of the passband width (one edge fixed) from  $125\mathrm{GHz}$  to  $11.6\mathrm{GHz}$ .

Fig. 1. Optical microscope image of a nearest-neighbor coupled 5-ring silicon filter, using rings in the racetrack configuration and directional waveguide couplers between adjacent rings, with the input and output single-mode silicon nanophotonic waveguides indicated. On-chip resistive micro-heaters, defined by doped silicon wires and not visible in a microscope image, are indicated with dark blue lines. One filter stage achieved  $50~\mathrm{dB}$  contrast and two such filter stages were cascaded to form a tunable-bandwidth multi-channel filter and achieved  $100~\mathrm{dB}$  contrast.

# II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The devices were fabricated using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible processes on silicon-insulator wafers at the Institute of Microelectronics (Singapore), and singulated into chips for testing using edge-coupled waveguide-to-fiber tapers. The insertion loss of each fiber-to-waveguide coupler was estimated as  $4.3\mathrm{dB}$  averaged over the wavelengths of interest, based on calibration measurements on separate test sites. The single-mode waveguides, with width  $0.55\mu \mathrm{m}$ , height  $0.22\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and slab thickness  $70\mathrm{nm}$ , were designed for low loss (approx.  $2\mathrm{dB / cm}$ ) transverse electric (TE) polarization transmission relative to the device plane. The microring resonators were in the racetrack configuration, with radius  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  and directional coupler length  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Within each section of 5 rings, the rings were nominally identical, with apodized waveguide-resonator coupling coefficients, formed by varying the inter-waveguide gap in the directional couplers, from  $210\mathrm{nm}$  for the first and last couplers to  $320\mathrm{nm}$  in the middle. Microheaters were formed using doped, zig-zag shaped line in the silicon slab, with width  $0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  and height  $70\mathrm{nm}$ , situated about  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  from the silicon waveguide forming the ring. On one representative chip, the average heater resistance was  $20\mathrm{k}\Omega$  with a standard deviation of  $4.3\mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

The intensity transmission and group delay were measured using an optical vector network analyzer (OVA) instrument, manufactured by Luna Technologies (Blacksburg, VA). The measurement technique is that of swept-wavelength interferometry, a homodyne measurement method which achieves high sensitivity and amplified spontaneous emission

noise rejection. The procedures used to calculate transmission and group delay from the measured Jones matrix, and calibration against a known standard (e.g., acetylene gas cell), are described in Ref. [14].

In the measurement setup, the total laser-to-detector insertion loss was about 19 dB, including four waveguide-to-fiber couplers with insertion loss 4.3 dB each. To overcome the coupling losses and maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio at the detector, the output of the OVA (average power  $200\mu \mathrm{W}$ ) was amplified (before the chip) by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), which was used in the saturation regime, followed by a programmable passive attenuator to reduce the power level incident on the silicon chip to a sufficiently low level to avoid nonlinearities. No amplification was performed after the chip. Calibration measurements showed that the EDFA and attenuator combination added negligible noise to the measurements when averaging over multiple data sets is performed, since such averaging results in the residual IL and GD ripple converging to the true device ripple as the number of acquired traces increases [15].

Transmission was calculated from the eigenvalues of the matrix  $\mathbf{J}^{\dagger}(\omega)\mathbf{J}(\omega)$ , where  $\mathbf{J}(\omega)$  is the measured Jones matrix of the filter at radian frequency  $\omega$ . At a given frequency, the greater eigenvalue represents the maximum transmission polarization state, and the smaller eigenvalue represents the minimum transmission polarization state [16]. By comparing with a transfer-matrix calculation of the coupled-ring transmission spectrum, we were able to identify which measured polarization corresponded to the TE polarization. The weakly-transmitted transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light is spectrally flat, with some incidental ripples not related to the free spectral range (FSR) of the microring; this behavior has also been seen in single-ring filters [17, Fig. 7(b)].

# III. MEASUREMENTS

# A. Single Stage (5 Ring, Fixed Bandwidth)

Fig. 2 shows a wide-wavelength-range transmission measurement through a single 5-ring silicon filter stage. Transmission of both TE and TM polarizations is shown; the former is the quantity of interest as the rings and couplers were designed using the group index of the TE polarization in mind, and silicon nanophotonic waveguides are significantly birefringent [18]. For a representative channel near  $1550\mathrm{nm}$  the measured insertion loss of the 5-ring filter was  $1.4~\mathrm{dB}$  and group delay ripple (GDR) was less than 3 ps over  $125\mathrm{GHz}$  bandwidth. From one band to the next, transmission uniformity of each passband was seen over a wide range of wavelengths, extending throughout the C and L telecommunications bands  $(1530 - 1610\mathrm{nm})$  since the standard deviation of the average band-center insertion loss across 11 passbands was only  $0.96\mathrm{dB}$ . The FSR of the microrings was  $7.3\mathrm{nm}$  near  $1550\mathrm{nm}$ . The systematic increase in the edge-to-edge passband width versus wavelength, from  $1.69\mathrm{nm}$  at  $1531\mathrm{nm}$  to  $2.39\mathrm{nm}$  near  $1606\mathrm{nm}$ , was due to the dispersion of typical silicon waveguide directional couplers [19], with  $|\kappa|$  varying monotonically from 0.366 to 0.464 over those wavelengths.

Fig. 2. Transmission of a single filter stage (5 rings) measured from 1530 to  $1610~\mathrm{nm}$ . The TE polarization, which is the quantity of interest, in view of the waveguide and coupler design, is shown in dark gray colored dots (raw measurement) and after moving-window smoothing filter of span  $50~\mathrm{pm}$  (shown using a red line). Transmission in the TM polarization is shown using a light gray colored line.

# B. Dual Stage (10 Ring, Coincident Passbands)

A 10-ring filter cascade was obtained by cascading two 5-ring structures, each on a separate chip. When the center wavelength of one group of five rings was thermally shifted relative to the other, the bandwidth could be narrowed without greatly degrading the ripple characteristics. We ensured that TE polarization was used at the input of both chips. The additional interconnection incurred an additional 9 dB insertion loss, but did not impact the measurement of either contrast or bandwidth.

The TE-polarized transmission through the dual-stage filter is shown in Fig. 3(a). High-dynamic range measurement of one passband is shown in Fig. 3(b). At the lowest transmission level, data taken with  $1.2\mathrm{pm}$  wavelength resolution (hardware limit) is shown with grey dots, and was subject to instrumental noise, as verified with a measurement of a fiber patch-cable replacing the silicon chip. The yellow line was obtained by a moving-window smoothing filter of span  $50~\mathrm{pm}$ ; since averaging repeated measurements, or increasing the smoothing filter window, did not reduce the noise floor, this yellow line was attributed to the device under test and defined the transmission floor.  $100\mathrm{dB}$  contrast was measured with regard to this floor;  $90\mathrm{dB}$  contrast was obtained with regard to the unfiltered instrumental-noise-defined floor. As shown in Fig. 3(c), less than  $3\mathrm{dB}$  insertion loss ripple was obtained over a bandwidth of  $100\mathrm{GHz}$ . As shown in Fig. 3(d), the GDR was less than  $5\mathrm{ps}$  over a continuous  $75\mathrm{GHz}$  bandwidth near the band-center. GDR was well fit by a simple polynomial chromatic dispersion profile.

# C. Dual Stage (10 Ring, Separated Passbands)

The thermo-optic (red) shift of the refractive index can be used to spectrally shift the resonance wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Using current driven through the on-chip microheater, with tuning efficiency  $1.25\mathrm{GHz / mW}$ , a tuning range of approx.  $50\mathrm{GHz}$  was seen before heater damage. Device failure occurred relatively easily in the present design

because the heaters were implemented using doped silicon meanders in the thin silicon slab, and were intended for fine-tuning the ring resonances, not large-range band shifting. However, a greater range of tuning ( $>100\mathrm{GHz}$ ) was possible by heating the chip itself through a thermo-electric module. In a cascaded configuration, when one set of rings was thermally shifted relative to the other, the composite filter bandwidth

Fig. 4. (a) Using on-chip microheaters, the passband of one 5-ring filter section was red-shifted, as shown in this low-dynamic-range measurement. Heater drive powers for A, B, C and D are  $0\mathrm{mW}$ ,  $9.3\mathrm{mW}$ ,  $15\mathrm{mW}$  and  $22\mathrm{mW}$ . (b) For a cascaded filter, the 3-dB bandwidth was reduced from  $\Delta f_{\mathrm{FWHM}} = 125\mathrm{GHz}$  to  $11.6\mathrm{GHz}$ , by tuning the temperature of one section of five rings relative to the other (held constant at  $23.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ), with relative temperature increase,  $\Delta T$  at  $\mathrm{A} = 0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\mathrm{B} = 3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\mathrm{C} = 5.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\mathrm{D} = 8.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\mathrm{E} = 10.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $\mathrm{F} = 12^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . To achieve a larger range of temperature shifts than in Fig. 4(a), the chip temperature was controlled using a thermo-electric module and temperatures were estimated using a measurement of resistance and a thermistor equation.

of each channel was reduced. The longer-wavelength edge of the cascaded passband stays fixed, and the shorter-wavelength edge of the passband is moved closer towards the other edge; such functionality is needed for filtering of a variable number of discrete channels in a telecommunication network, among other applications. Full pole-zero tunability, as shown by other work [8], is not needed for such filtering; here, a single control voltage is sufficient to tune the bandwidth. Shown in Fig. 4(b) are snapshots of a representative transmission passband reduced from  $125\mathrm{GHz}$  to  $11.6\mathrm{GHz}$ , i.e., more than a  $10\times$  range, at discrete points along the tuning curve.

# IV.DISCUSSION

Table I summarizes some of the best-performing silicon photonic multi-stage filters made using a variety of different approaches; some combine multiple elements (rings and Mach-Zehnder interferometer) in a single stage, some offer full control over poles and zeros whereas others (like ours) demonstrate tunable bandwidth via simpler means. Some designs offer electro-optic tunability, whereas others demonstrate thermo-optic tunability. Taken together, these results show silicon photonic chip-scale multi-stage filters evolving to show a level of performance approaching that of much larger, table-top instruments in most metrics.

Now, we discuss some fundamental aspects for further improving contrast in a multi-ring cascade. Light propagates along the axial coordinate of the device  $z$  with exponential attenuation, i.e.,  $\exp (-\alpha z)$  for passband and stopband wavelengths, but with small and large values of  $\alpha$  in the two cases. For passband wavelengths, the loss coefficient [20]  $\alpha = \alpha_{\mathrm{wg}}\pi R / |\kappa |$  in terms of the propagation loss of a silicon nanophotonic waveguide, which constitutes the racetrack resonators, and has a loss coefficient  $\alpha_{\mathrm{wg}}\approx 2\mathrm{dB.cm}^{-1}$ , the bending radius  $R$ , and the magnitude of the inter-ring coupling coefficient  $|\kappa |$ . For stop-band wavelengths, the propagation coefficient can be estimated by Bloch's theory with a complex propagation coefficient, and is  $\alpha = -\cosh^{-1}(1 / |\kappa |)$ . Therefore, for an  $N$ -ring chain, ignoring apodization, the contrast is

$$
\frac {T _ {\text {p a s s b a n d}}}{T _ {\text {s t o p b a n d}}} = \frac {\exp \left[ - a _ {\mathrm {w g}} \pi R N / | \kappa | \right]}{\exp \left[ - N \cosh^ {- 1} (1 / | \kappa |) \right]}. \tag {1}
$$

The subtlety in Eq. (1) is that recent simulation and experimental studies [21] on realistic (i.e., with disorder effects) silicon coupled microrings suggest that the number of resonators  $N$  that can be coupled in a disorder-free manner is not independent of  $|\kappa|$ , but is proportional to  $|\kappa|^2$ . Then, a robust strategy to achieve high contrast is to increase the coupling coefficient: A larger  $|\kappa|$  reduces the contrast in a single-stage filter, but the overall contrast can be increased by supporting longer chains of resonators than possible in the small- $|\kappa|$  case. Another advantage of a higher value of  $|\kappa|$  is that the filter has a greater transmission bandwidth, and therefore, a wider tunable bandwidth range in the case of the cascaded-filter scheme shown here.

# V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our results demonstrate measurement of record contrast between in-band and stop-band transmission, along with good band-to-band uniformity, simple thermo-optic bandwidth tunability, low group delay ripple and low (on-chip) insertion loss, using compact coupled microrings in silicon photonics. High-performance, high-contrast tunable bandwidth filtering is available only in much larger, bench-top systems today (Finisar WaveShaper, Santec OTF etc.) and chip-scale filter technology can benefit flexible bandwidth channel plans in next-generation optical networks, improved noise rejection in tunable lasers and receivers, isolating wavelength conversion products and blocking residual pump light, improving the quantum visibility of photon pairs generated by spontaneous nonlinear optical processes, etc.
