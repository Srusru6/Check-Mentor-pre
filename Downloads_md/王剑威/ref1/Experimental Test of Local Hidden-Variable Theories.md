The statistics on the eight-prong data are not good but show characteristics similar to those for six-prong.

We present this dramatic behavior of the two  $\pi^{-}$ 's as functions of their rapidity separation as a challenge to any theory of inclusive reactions.

# Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories*

Stuart J. Freedman and John F. Clauser

Department of Physics and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 (Received 4 February 1972)

We have measured the linear polarization correlation of the photons emitted in an atomic cascade of calcium. It has been shown by a generalization of Bell's inequality that the existence of local hidden variables imposes restrictions on this correlation in conflict with the predictions of quantum mechanics. Our data, in agreement with quantum mechanics, violate these restrictions to high statistical accuracy, thus providing strong evidence against local hidden-variable theories.

Since quantum mechanics was first developed, there have been repeated suggestions that its statistical features possibly might be described by an underlying deterministic substructure. Such

features, then, arise because a quantum state represents a statistical ensemble of "hidden-variable states." Proofs by von Neumann and others, demonstrating the impossibility of a hid

den-variable substructure consistent with quantum mechanics, rely on various assumptions concerning the character of the hidden variables. $^{1}$  Bell has argued that these assumptions are unduly restrictive. However, by considering an idealized case of two spatially separated but quantum-mechanically correlated systems, he was able to show that any hidden-variable theory satisfying only the natural assumption of "locality" also leads to predictions ("Bell's inequality") in conflict with quantum mechanics. $^{2}$

Bell's proof was extended to realizable systems by Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt, who also pointed out that their generalization of Bell's inequality can be tested experimentally, thus testing all local hidden-variable theories, but that existing experimental results were insufficient for this purpose. This Letter reports the results of an experiment which are sufficiently precise to rule out local hidden-variable theories with high statistical accuracy

In the present work we measured the correlation in linear polarization of two photons  $\gamma_{1}$  and  $\gamma_{2}$  emitted in a  $J = 0\rightarrow J = 1\rightarrow J = 0$  atomic cascade. The decaying atoms were viewed by two symmetrically placed optical systems, each consisting of two lenses, a wavelength filter, a rotatable and removable polarizer, and a single-photon detector (see Fig. 1). The following quantities were measured:  $R(\varphi)$ , the coincidence rate for two-photon detection, as a function of the angle  $\varphi$  between the planes of linear polarization defined by the orientation of the inserted polarizers;  $R_{1}$ , the coincidence rate with polarizer 2 removed;  $R_{2}$ , the coincidence rate with polarizer 1 removed;  $R_{0}$ , the coincidence rate with both polarizers re

moved. Quantum mechanics predicts that  $R(\varphi)$  and  $R_0$  are related as follows<sup>3,5</sup>:

$$
\begin{array}{l} R (\varphi) / R _ {0} = \frac {1}{4} \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {1} + \epsilon_ {m} ^ {1}\right) \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {2} + \epsilon_ {m} ^ {2}\right) + \frac {1}{4} \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {1} - \epsilon_ {m} ^ {1}\right) \\ \times \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {2} - \epsilon_ {m} ^ {2}\right) F _ {1} (\theta) \cos 2 \varphi , \tag {1a} \\ \end{array}
$$

while

$$
R _ {1} / R _ {0} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {1} + \epsilon_ {m} ^ {1}\right), \tag {1b}
$$

and

$$
R _ {2} / R _ {0} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\epsilon_ {M} ^ {2} + \epsilon_ {m} ^ {2}\right). \tag {1c}
$$

Here  $\epsilon_{M}^{i}\left(\epsilon_{m}^{i}\right)$  is the transmittance of the  $i$ th polarizer for light polarized parallel (perpendicular) to the polarizer axis, and  $F_{1}(\theta)$  is a function of the half-angle  $\theta$  subtended by the primary lenses. It represents a depolarization due to noncollinearity of the two photons, and approaches unity for infinitesimal detector solid angles. [For this experiment,  $\theta \approx 30^{\circ}$ , and  $F_{1}(30^{\circ}) \approx 0.99$ .]

We make the following assumptions for any local hidden-variable theory: (1) The two photons propagate as separated localized particles. (2) A binary selection process occurs for each photon at each polarizer (transmission or no-transmission). This selection does not depend upon the orientation of the distant polarizer.

In addition, we make the following assumption to allow a comparison of the generalization of Bell's inequality with out experiment: (3) All photons incident on a detector have a probability of detection that is independent of whether or not the photon has passed through a polarizer.

The above assumptions constrain the coincidence rates by the following inequalities:

$$
- 1 \leqslant \Delta (\varphi) \leqslant 0, \tag {2}
$$

where

$$
\Delta (\varphi) = \frac {3 R (\varphi)}{R _ {0}} - \frac {R (3 \varphi)}{R _ {0}} - \frac {R _ {1} + R _ {2}}{R _ {0}}.
$$

For sufficiently small detector solid angles and highly efficient polarizers, these inequalities (2) are not satisfied by the quantum-mechanical prediction (1) for a range of values of  $\varphi$ . Maximum violations occur at  $\varphi = 22\frac{1}{2}^{\circ}\left[\Delta (\varphi) > 0\right]$  and  $\varphi = 67\frac{1}{2}^{\circ}\left[\Delta (\varphi) < -1\right]$ . At these angles of maximum violation, inequalities (2) can be combined into the simpler and more convenient expression

$$
\delta = \left| R \left(2 2 \frac {1}{2} ^ {\circ}\right) / R _ {0} - R \left(6 7 \frac {1}{2} ^ {\circ}\right) / R _ {0} \right| - \frac {1}{4} \leqslant 0, \tag {3}
$$

which does not involve  $R_{1}$  or  $R_{2}$ .

that of Kocher and Commins. A calcium atomic beam effused from a tantalum oven, as shown in Fig. 1. The continuum output of a deuterium arc lamp (ORIEL C-42-72-12) was passed through an interference filter [250 Å full width at half-maximum (FWHM), 20% transmission at 2275 Å] and focused on the beam. Resonance absorption of a 2275 Å photon excited calcium atoms to the  $3d4p^1 P_1$  state. Of the atoms that did not decay directly to the ground state, about 7% decayed to the  $4p^{21}S_{0}$  state, from which they cascaded through the  $4s4p^1 P_1$  intermediate state to the ground state with the emission of two photons at 5513 Å ( $\gamma_{1}$ ) and 4227 Å ( $\gamma_{2}$ ) (see Fig. 2). At the interaction region (roughly, a cylinder 5 mm high and 3 mm in diameter) the density of the calcium was about  $1 \times 10^{10}$  atoms/cm $^3$ . To avoid spherical aberrations which would have reduced counter efficiencies, aspheric primary lenses (8.0 cm diam,  $f = 0.8$ ) were used. Photons  $\gamma_{1}$  were selected by a filter with 10 Å FWHM and 50% transmission, and  $\gamma_{2}$  by a filter with 6 Å FWHM and 20% transmission. The requirement for large efficient linear polarizers led us to employ "pile-of-plates" polarizers. Each polarizer consisted of ten 0.3-mm-thick glass sheets inclined nearly at Brewster's angle. The sheets were attached to hinged frames, and could be folded completely out of the optical path. A Geneva mechanism rotated each polarizer through increments of  $22\frac{1}{2}^\circ$ . The measured transmittances of the polarizers were  $\epsilon_{M}^{1} = 0.97 \pm 0.01$ ,  $\epsilon_{m}^{1} = 0.038 \pm 0.004$ ,  $\epsilon_{M}^{2} = 0.96 \pm 0.01$ , and  $\epsilon_{m}^{2} = 0.037 \pm 0.004$ . The photomultiplier detectors (RCA C31000E, quantum efficiency ≈ 0.13 at 5513 Å; and RCA 8850, quantum efficiency ≈ 0.28 at 4227 Å) were cooled, reducing dark rates to 75 and 200 counts/sec, respectively. The measured counter efficiencies with po

larizers removed were  $\eta_{1} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-3}$  and  $\eta_{2} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-3.9}$ .

A diagram of the electronics is included in Fig. 1. The overall system time resolution was about 1.5 nsec. The short intermediate state lifetime ( $\sim$ 5 nsec) permitted a narrow coincidence window (8.1 nsec). A second coincidence channel displaced in time by 50 nsec monitored the number of accidental coincidences, the true coincidence rate being determined by subtraction.[10] A time-to-amplitude converter and pulse-height analyzer measured the time-delay spectrum of the two photons. The resulting exponential gave the intermediate state lifetime.[11]

The coincidence rates depended upon the beam and lamp intensities, the latter gradually decreasing during a run. The typical coincidence rate with polarizers removed ranged from 0.3 to 0.1 countx/sec, and the accidental rate ranged from 0.01 to 0.002 counts/sec. Long runs required by the low coincidence rate necessitated automatic data collections.

The system was cycled with 100-sec counting periods. Periods with one or both polarizers inserted alternated with periods in which both polarizers were removed. Both polarizers rotated according to a prescribed sequence. For a given run,  $R(\varphi) / R_0$  was calculated by summing counts for all configurations corresponding to angle  $\varphi$  and dividing by half the sum of the counts in the adjacent periods of the sequence in which both polarizers were moved. Data for  $R_1 / R_0$  and  $R_2 / R_0$  were analyzed in a similar fashion. The values given here are averages over the orientation of the inserted polarizer. This cycling and averaging procedure minimized the effects of drift and apparatus asymmetry.

The results of the measurements of the correlation  $R(\varphi) / R_0$ , corresponding to a total integration time of  $\sim 200 \, \text{h}$ , are shown in Fig. 3. All error limits are conservative estimates of 1 standard deviation. Using the values at  $22\frac{1}{2}^\circ$  and  $67\frac{1}{2}^\circ$ , we obtain  $\delta = 0.050 \pm 0.008$  in clear violation of inequality (3). Furthermore, we observe no evidence for a deviation from the predictions of quantum mechanics, calculated from the measured polarizer efficiencies and solid angles, and shown as the solid curve in Fig. 3. We consider these results to be strong evidence against local hidden-variable theories.

4 A hidden-variable theory need not require that  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  be independent of the orientation of the inserted polarizer, and we do not assume this independence in our data analysis. However, the results are consistent with  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  being independent of angle, and for simplicity they are so denoted.

The inequality  $\Delta (\varphi)\leqslant 0$  is derived in Refs. 3 and 5. The other forms of the hidden-variable restriction are obtained by similar arguments; see S. Freedman, Ph.

The counter efficiencies are given by  $\eta_{i} = (\Omega_{i} / 4\pi)T_{i}\times \epsilon_{i}L_{i}$ , where  $\Omega_{i}$  is the solid angle,  $T_{i}$  is the transmission of the filter,  $\epsilon_{i}$  is the quantum efficiency, and  $L_{i}$  accounts for other losses. The measurement of  $\eta_{2}$  was made, employing the properties of the calcium cascade, by comparing the coincidence rate and the  $\gamma_{1}$  singles rate after suitable background correction;  $\eta_{1}$  was then inferred from the known quantum efficiencies and filter transmissions assuming that  $\Omega_{i}$  and  $L_{i}$  were the same for both detector systems.  
An estimate of the accidental rate was also obtained from the singles rates. The two estimates gave consistent results. In fact, our conclusions are not changed if accidents are neglected entirely; the signal-to-accidental ratio with polarizer removed is about 40 to 1 for the data presented.  
11 Resonance trapping, encountered at high beam densities, resulted in a lengthening of the observed lifetime and a slight decrease in the polarization correlation amplitude, see J. P. Barrat, J. Phys. Radium 20, 541, 633 (1959). At low beam densities the measured lifetime is consistent with previously measured values. See W. L. Weise, M. W. Smith, and B. M. Miles, Atomic Transition Probabilities, U. S. National Bureau of Standards Reference Data Series—22 (U.S. GPO, Washington, D.C., 1969), Vol. 2.  
12 The results that are of interest in comparison with the hidden-variable inequalities are  $R_1 / R_0 = 0.497 \pm 0.009$ ,  $R_2 / R_0 = 0.499 \pm 0.009$ ,  $R(22\frac{1}{2}^\circ) / R_0 = 0.400 \pm 0.007$ , and  $R(67\frac{1}{2}^\circ) / R_0 = 0.100 \pm 0.003$ . We thus obtain  $\Delta(22\frac{1}{2}^\circ) = 0.104 \pm 0.026$  and  $\Delta(67\frac{1}{2}^\circ) = -1.097 \pm 0.018$ , in violation of inequalities (2).
