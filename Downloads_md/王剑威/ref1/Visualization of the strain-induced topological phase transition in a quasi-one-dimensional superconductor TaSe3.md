Control of the phase transition from topological to normal insulators can allow for an on/off switching of spin current. While topological phase transitions have been realized by elemental substitution in semiconducting alloys, such an approach requires preparation of materials with various compositions. Thus it is quite far from a feasible device application, which demands a reversible operation. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the strain-driven band-structure evolution of the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ . We demonstrate that it undergoes reversible strain-induced topological phase transitions from a strong topological insulator phase with spin-polarized, quasi-one-dimensional topological surface states, to topologically trivial semimetal and band insulating phases. The quasi-one-dimensional superconductor  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  provides a suitable platform for engineering the topological spintronics, for example as an on/off switch for a spin current that is robust against impurity scattering.

Since the discovery of topological insulators (TIs) $^{1-5}$ , many attempts have been made to control their fascinating properties. The most direct way is to use the phase transition from topological to normal insulator, which has been so far realized by elemental substitution in semiconducting alloys $^{6-12}$ ; the spin-orbit coupling and lattice constant are both varied simultaneously, leading to band inversion or eliminating it. To enable the reversible control of the phase transition, required for device application, using the strain effect, which can tune the lattice constant, would be a better and simpler approach. For this approach, we need to find a suitable material, which has the correct topological properties and can easily change its lattice constant by strain.

In the transition-metal trichalcogenides  $\mathrm{MX}_3$ $(\mathrm{M} = \mathrm{Nb},\mathrm{Ta};\mathrm{X} = \mathrm{S},$  Se), physical properties vary and electronic orders evolve differently in accordance with the distinctive stacking sequences of the one-dimensional (1D) chain variants. Among the series of  $\mathrm{MX}_3,$ $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  is especially appealing in that superconductivity emerges at low temperatures  $(\sim 2\mathrm{K})^{14}$  , in contrast with the other members, which typically undergo charge density wave transitions. Due to its quasi-1D metallic character, it is proposed from the application point of view that  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  is suitable for the downscaled local interconnectors in electronic devices[15,16]. More intriguingly, recent ab initio calculations predict that semimetallic  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  belongs to a three-dimensional (3D) strong TI phase[17]. This compound has been further suggested as a candidate for a topological superconductor[17]

with advantages over other compounds $^{18-26}$  in that the topological surface states (TSSs) are formed at the Fermi level  $(E_{\mathrm{F}})$ ; the superconductivity occurs in stoichiometric crystals without suffering from the doping-induced inhomogeneity; and the crystal structure is built from van der Waals stacking that is suitable for the application $^{27}$ . Furthermore, this compound is in proximity to other topological phases, which thus potentially brings the attractive functionality of controlling the topological properties by the fine-tuning of a single physical parameter $^{17}$ .

The electronic structure of  $\mathrm{TaSe_3}$  was shown by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) more than a decade ago[28], as well as in a recent study with much better resolution[29]. We use various types of ARPES techniques to observe the band structure of  $\mathrm{TaSe_3}$ . In particular, spin-resolved ARPES (SARPES) with high momentum and energy resolutions is indispensable to identify the topological nature of this compound. Hence, we employ a laser-based SARPES that satisfies such requirements, and unambiguously reveal that  $\mathrm{TaSe_3}$  is indeed in a strong TI phase, as theory predicts. Moreover, two-step phase transitions are demonstrated by means of an in situ strain control of the band structure: by applying tensile strain to the samples, we observe a drastic evolution of the band structure, demonstrating the topological phase transition from a strong TI phase to a trivial semimetal phase. Upon further increase of the strain, the system eventually becomes a trivial band insulator, realizing the metal-insulator transition. The transition

Adjacent 1D chains have an offset of  $b/2$  along the chain direction, and the bonding between them is shown by the red dotted lines forming the ( $\bar{1}01$ ) layers, held in a stack by van der Waals forces. b, The side view of the crystal structure along the chain. The unit cell is indicated by the black lines, and the red dashed line marks the ( $\bar{1}01$ ) natural cleavage plane in both panels a and b. c, The image of the samples used for the ARPES measurements, indicating the typical crystal size with  $\sim500\mu\mathrm{m}$  in length and  $50-100\mu\mathrm{m}$  in width. d, A 3D bulk BZ and the projected ( $\bar{1}01$ ) surface BZ. The  $k_x$  and  $k_y$  are in plane, with the former perpendicular to the chain direction and the latter parallel to it;  $k_z$  is along the out-of-plane direction.  $a^{\star}$ ,  $b^{\star}$  and  $c^{\star}$  denote the reciprocal lattice vectors. e, Electronic structure of  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  with spin-orbit coupling. The parity eigenvalues at the B, Z and D points are indicated explicitly. f, A 3D plot of the band dispersion on the ( $\bar{1}01$ ) surface BZ (light blue box) probed by  $50\mathrm{eV}$  photons. The colour bar represents the ARPES intensities from high (H) to low (L) in arbitrary units. g,h, Calculated TSSs and experimental band dispersion, respectively, across the  $\bar{x}$  point in the momentum range indicated by the red arrows in f. The possible TSSs in h are also indicated. i,j, Calculated surface states and experimental band dispersion, respectively, across the  $\bar{\Gamma}$  point in the momentum range indicated by the black arrows in f. The photon energies used in h (50 eV) and j (30 eV) were selected so that the surface states were better resolved. See Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 for more detailed discussions about the spectra obtained using different photon energies and polarizations.

from topologically non-trivial to trivial state is unique in  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ ; while the strain control of the topological state was previously attempted for  $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$  (ref. 30), the variation of the band structure by strain was rather small, exhibiting only a slight energy shift of the Dirac point. The uniaxial strain method was also effectively used to align the nematic superconducting domains in Sr-doped  $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$  (ref. 31); such an effect, however, is not as drastic in the energy scale as that in the topological phase transition as realized in  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ .  $\mathrm{ZrTe}_5$  is another good system to use to control the topological phase via strain[32,33], but the transition proposed was between two non-trivial phases (the weak TI and strong TI phases), in contrast with the present results. Reversible control from the topological to non-topological phase in a single compound,  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ , without the necessity of elemental substitution as in alloys, opens up a new path towards applications in spintronics or optoelectronics. In particular, the controlling of the topological phase transition accompanied by superconductivity will bring entire new ideas for future applications.

The  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  crystal is built from the stacking of layers bonded together by weak van der Waals forces (Fig. 1a,b). As a result, we expect the (101) plane to be at the surface after the sample is cleaved

(Fig. 1c), which has indeed been confirmed by our X-ray diffraction measurements (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The band structure calculated along high-symmetry momentum lines (Fig. 1d) is plotted in Fig. 1e; band inversion occurs around the Z point, opening an energy gap induced by the spin-orbit coupling effect (the inset of Fig. 1e). We have used synchrotron-ARPES with tunable photon energies to experimentally clarify the overall electronic structure of  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ . Figure 1f exhibits the overview of band dispersions observed on the  $(\overline{1}01)$  surface Brillouin zone (BZ; Fig. 1d). In Fig.  $1\mathrm{g - j}$ , we compare the calculated surface-state spectra (left panels) and ARPES dispersions (right panels) across the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point (surface BZ edge, top panels) and  $\widetilde{\Gamma}$  point (surface BZ centre, bottom panels); a good agreement between the two is confirmed, regardless of the momentum cuts.

The surface and bulk states have distinct spectral properties and can be selectively enhanced by using proper photon energies and light polarizations (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). In Supplementary Fig. 2m,n, we plot the Fermi surface mappings and the constant-energy mappings at a high binding energy  $(E_{\mathrm{B}} = 0.6\mathrm{eV})$ , respectively, with different  $k_z$  values

along the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 1d) accessed by changing the photon energies. Unlike the mapping at  $E_{\mathrm{B}} = 0.6 \, \mathrm{eV}$ , the Fermi surface is found to be non-dispersive along  $k_{z}$ , suggesting that the low-energy, sharp features seen in Fig. 1h very likely come from surface states. The TSSs are expected, by calculations, to be confined in a limited momentum area around the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point and within a small bulk gap opened at  $E_{\mathrm{F}}$ ; thus, ultra-high energy and momentum resolutions are required in ARPES experiments to visualize the predicted TSSs, and most importantly, the spin-resolved measurements at high resolution are indispensable to show that the surface states observed indeed have a topological origin.

The fine details of the low-energy electronic structure near  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  on the (101) surface BZ have been examined at high resolution by a  $7\mathrm{eV}$  laser-ARPES equipped with a 3D spin-resolved detector. We focus on the momentum area in the red dashed square in Fig. 2a, surrounding the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point; calculations predict that the TSSs, characterized by sharp spectra near  $E_{\mathrm{p}}$  will emerge between the bulk conduction band (BCB) and bulk valence band (BVB) when approaching the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point, where these bands are inverted. In Fig. 2b-e, we compare the Fermi surfaces (top panels) and dispersions (bottom panels) across the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point, obtained by calculations (left panels) and ARPES (right panels); the ARPES data are also three-dimensionally displayed in Fig. 2f for better understanding. The low-energy spectra measured by laser-ARPES (Fig. 2c,e,f) clearly disentangle fine structures near the  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  point, which agree well with the calculated TSSs in the strong TI phase (Fig. 2b,d). To examine more details of the TSSs, we magnify the calculated and ARPES dispersions across  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  in Fig. 2i,j, respectively. The momentum distribution curves (MDCs) extracted at  $E_{\mathrm{F}}$  (Fig. 2g,h) identify two pairs of TSSs ( $TSS_{1}$  and  $TSS_{2}$ ) and one pair of CCBs, indicating good consistency between the calculations and ARPES measurements. As detailed in Supplementary Fig. 4, the band dispersion of  $TSS_{1}$  goes up in energy with increasing  $k_{y}$  along the in-plane direction (Fig. 1d) and merges into the CCB around  $k_{y} = 0.1\AA^{-1}$ , whereas that of  $TSS_{2}$  goes down and merges into the BVB, just as expected for a strong TI phase (Fig. 2i). Spectra assigned to CCBs have relatively sharp peaks, unlike the continuum intensities for the surface band calculations (Fig. 2i), because of the following: ARPES at one photon energy, in principle, captures the band along a  $k_{x} - k_{y}$  sheet at a specific  $k_{z}$ , and thus can exhibit sharp peaks in the spectra not only for the surface band but also for the bulk band, while the latter could be suppressed by the  $k_{z}$  broadening in photoemission. This contrasts with the surface calculations, which project the bulk band spectra over the whole range of  $k_{z}$ .

To finalize our conclusion that  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  belongs to a strong TI phase, we demonstrate that the surface states we observed are spin-polarized, just as expected by the calculations. For this purpose, the experimental setting is now switched to the spin-resolved mode. Figure 2l plots the SARPES data, which map the spin  $k_{x}$  component (slightly off from the  $k_{x}$  direction in reality, due to the experimental geometry) measured for the energy-momentum region surrounded by the white dashed box in Fig. 2j; one can see how high the momentum resolution is in laser-SARPES compared with that in synchrotron-ARPES (Fig. 1h). To examine more details, we extract, in Fig. 2n-q, the spin-resolved energy distribution curves (EDCs) at the four specific  $k$  points indicated by arrows in Fig. 2j; the observed surface states are clearly spin-polarized (Supplementary Fig. 5 for the complete spin-polarization components). In Fig. 2r, the magnitude of spin-polarization is quantified for two outer  $k$  points with opposite signs  $(+k_{1}$  and  $-k_{1})$ . The spin-polarization is reversed both with different energies and between  $\pm k$ . Intriguingly, we also found that these relationships on reversal are also swapped between different  $|k|$ $(\pm k_{1}$  and  $\pm k_{2})$ , which yields a nodal point with spin degeneracy, possibly due to the band hybridization of TSSs. Note here that, while the spectral intensities in Fig. 2o are dominated by the down-spin (blue spectrum), mostly due to the matrix element effect, the spin degeneracy lifted by  $\sim 10\mathrm{meV}$  is clearly resolved, validating the spin-texture reversal. For clarity, the

experimentally obtained conclusion is summarized in Fig. 2m by showing the spin-integrated EDCs with red and blue colours assigned for up-spin and down-spin, respectively. All these features in the spin texture are reproduced well by calculations (Fig. 2k), showing that our experiments successfully captured the spin-momentum-locked TSSs, and hence established a strong TI phase in  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ . We note that  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  is not an insulator with a fully opened bulk gap in its strong TI phase, but a semimetal with a finite density of states at the Fermi level, which is a required condition to realize superconductivity, making this compound all the more fascinating for possible applications with topological superconductivity.

The quasi-1D structure is advantageous to modify the band structure effectively by uniaxial pressure. Hence,  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  built from chains is the ideal material to realize the strain-induced topological phase transition. Here we use the simplest technique of applying pressure to substances, which just mechanically bends a crystal on a substrate (Fig. 3a,b) $^{34}$ , and reveal a systematic variation of the band structure under the tensile strain along the chain direction, which is controlled in situ. The samples were mounted on the sample platform of the strain device shown in Fig. 3a, by which tensile strain is applied via tightening four screws (Fig. 3b). We measured the amount of strain at the sample position using commercial strain gauges (Fig. 3c), and made a diagram relating the turning angle of the screws and the resulting strain (Fig. 3d), which was then used for the in situ strain control. The reliability of this diagram was evaluated by simulating the strain distribution in the device with finite element analysis (Fig. 3b); good agreement was confirmed between the simulation and the strain gauge measurements (Methods for more information about the strain device and the estimation of the strain).

Figure 3e-g presents the evolution of Fermi surface mappings by laser-ARPES with increasing tensile strain along the chain (0.2%, 1.1% and 2.4%, respectively), signifying two-step phase transitions. The high intensities seen at low strain (Fig. 3e) are significantly suppressed by applying higher strain (Fig. 3f), indicating that the TSSs disappear and thus the system has transitioned from a strong TI phase to a trivial semimetal phase; its semimetallic nature will be confirmed by comparisons with calculations in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11. The vague intensities left for the bulk states (Fig. 3f) eventually vanish with further increase of the strain (Fig. 3g), revealing a transition of the system to a trivial band insulator phase, which opens a bulk gap at  $E_{\mathrm{P}}$

More details of these two-step phase transitions are examined in Fig. 3h-s, which exhibits the evolution of band dispersions across  $\widetilde{\mathrm{X}}$  and  $\widetilde{\Gamma}$  (red and black arrows, respectively, in Fig.  $3\mathrm{e - g})$  with gradually increasing tensile strain along the chain via in situ control. The highly intense signals due to TSSs are distinguished close to  $E_{\mathrm{F}}$  at zero strain (Fig. 3h) and agree with the results in Fig. 2e; the differences in the spectral sharpness among these data mostly come from the different quality of the cleaved surfaces and different light polarizations used in the two different ARPES apparatuses used for the spin-texture and strain-control measurements (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8 for TSSs obtained at different conditions). By applying tensile strain, the hole bands around  $\widetilde{\mathrm{X}}$  and  $\widetilde{\Gamma}$  both gradually shifted towards higher binding energies, demonstrating successful band-engineering by strain. The key features associated with the phase transitions are seen especially in close vicinity to  $E_{\mathrm{F}}$  around the  $\widetilde{\mathrm{X}}$  point. The high intensities of TSSs seen at zero strain (Fig. 3h) were substantially suppressed at around  $1\%$  strain (Fig. 3j,k), which was then followed by a gap opening with larger strain (Fig. 3l,m). These behaviours are more directly demonstrated in Fig. 3t,u by extracting MDCs at  $E_{\mathrm{F}}$  across  $\widetilde{\mathrm{X}}$  and EDCs at  $k_{\mathrm{F}}$  (indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 3h) around  $\widetilde{\mathrm{X}}$  , respectively, which reveal the spectral evolution of TSSs (marked by red arrows in these panels). As the strain was increased in the strong TI phase, the TSSs became confined into a smaller momentum area (Fig. 3t), as a result of the reduced band inversion. Further increase of strain caused the

spectral peaks of the TSSs to disappear by eliminating the band inversion, and consequently the system transitioned to a trivial semimetal phase. Eventually, the strain got large enough to reopen the band gap, which totally eliminated the spectral intensity around  $E_{\mathrm{p}}$  and thus the system transitioned to a trivial insulator phase. A previous study has shown an anomalous strain effect on the resistivity, which increased by several orders of magnitude when the applied strain along the chain reached  $\sim 0.6\%$  (ref. [35]), in agreement with our observation of the band structure and the depletion of the spectral intensity at  $E_{\mathrm{p}}$  shown in Fig. 3v.

To fully understand the mechanism of the phase transitions we observed, ab initio calculations were performed for  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  under strain along the chain direction. The evolution of the bulk electronic structure in the calculations (Fig. 4b-d) nicely illustrates the mechanism of the phase transition induced by reducing and eliminating the band inversion with increasing tensile strain, which are manifested as the closing and reopening of a gap at the Z point. The calculated surface spectra of the Fermi surface (Fig. 4f-h) and energy dispersions (Fig. 4k-p) across  $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$  and  $\widetilde{\Gamma}$  both reproduce our observations well, of two-step phase transitions from a strong

TI phase to a trivial semimetal phase, and then to a trivial band insulator phase, with increasing tensile strain up to  $2.5\%$ , which is comparable to the maximum strain value in our experiments. The spectral agreement between experimental observations (Fig. 3f,k,q in the semimetal phase and Fig. 3g,m,s in the insulator phase) and calculations (Fig. 4g,m,n and Fig. 4h,o,p, respectively) is excellent (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 for direct comparisons).

We also calculated the effect of compressive strain on  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  (Fig. 4a,e,i,j); it not only enlarges the band inversion at the Z point, but also inverts another band at the B point (Fig. 4a), triggering an

additional topological phase transition from a strong TI phase to a weak TI phase, where the TSSs emerge only at the side surface (Fig. 4q). Applying compressive strain to quasi-1D crystals is experimentally very challenging since a compression in the chain direction easily bends or wrinkles the crystals, which releases the compressive force before reaching the amount one intends to apply. Even so, we have applied compressive strain to some extent and successfully observed the enhancement of band inversion, which indicates that the system was driven towards the weak TI phase by the compressive strain, as calculations predict (Supplementary Figs. 13

and 14); nevertheless, the decisive evidence for the weak TI phase is lacking, so we leave it for a future work.

In Fig. 4r, we summarize the evolution of the direct energy gaps at B and Z, which determines the bulk topology, and also the indirect gap of the system, which reveals the metallic nature of  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$ , with strain applied along the chain  $\delta_{b}$ . The topological quantum critical points have been obtained at  $\delta_{b} \approx -0.75\%$  and  $0.95\%$ ; the band inversion occurs at both B and Z for  $\delta_{b} < -0.75\%$ , and only at Z for  $-0.75\% < \delta_{b} < 0.95\%$ , and eventually it is ruled out for  $\delta_{b} > 0.95\%$ . At these three values, a weak TI, a strong TI, and a trivial semimetal phase appear, respectively. Moreover, we also found another type of critical point at  $\delta_{b} \approx 1.75\%$ , across which the metal-insulator transition occurs. The correspondence between the  $\delta_{b}$  values applied and the electronic phases obtained in calculations matches surprisingly well with our experimental results (Fig. 3v).

The strain-induced topological phase transition can be generally interpreted as follows. The tensile strain increases the distance among the atoms building the crystal, which suppresses the hopping integral of electrons and thus shrinks the electronic bands. As a result, the overlapping of the conduction and valence bands is diminished, and eventually, the band inversion is removed with enough strain, causing the transition from the non-trivial topological phase to the trivial phase. The calculations in Fig. 4b-d clearly show that the valence bands are narrowed as tensile strain increases, removing the band inversion and eventually opening the full band gap. The opposite occurs with compressive strain (Fig. 4a): the electronic bands expand due to the larger hopping integral of electrons, which enhances the overlapping of the conduction and valence bands. Consequently, another band inversion occurs, causing the transition from the strong TI phase to the weak TI phase.

The quasi-1D topological state of a superconductor  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  that we have revealed could have several scientific and technological implications. In particular,  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  has an excellent functionality in that the band topology is easily controlled by mechanical strain, leading to the reversible on/off switching of highly directional, dense spin currents that are protected from impurity scattering (Supplementary Fig. 10 for the reversibility). To date, the topological phase transition from a strong TI phase to a trivial insulator phase has been observed directly by ARPES for alloys, where the bulk topology is controlled by elemental substitution, which varies both the lattice constant and the spin-orbit coupling strength. Here we have demonstrated a method that tunes only the lattice constant by strain, and that is much simpler, reversible, and thus promising for future applications. Hence, our experimental observations of the topological phase transition between a strong TI state and a trivial state, realized in a superconductor, will prompt further basic and technological research for engineering topological spintronics or optoelectronics that exploit the topological phase transition and the interplay of topological state with superconductivity, likely leading to the topological superconducting state. While further work is required, the expectation of the ability to control the Majorana fermions will encourage follow-up research on new strategies for realizing quantum computation.

# Methods

Samples. High-quality monoclinic whisker crystals of  $\mathrm{TaSe}_3$  were synthesized by the vapour phase transport method, with lattice constants  $a = 10.405\AA$ ,  $b = 3.499\AA$ ,  $c = 9.826\AA$  and  $\beta = 106.26^{\circ}$  (ref. 36). Typical samples used for the ARPES and SARPES measurements are shown in Fig. 1c with an in-plane dimension of  $\sim 500\times 50$  to  $\sim 500\times 100\mu \mathrm{m}^2$ . The samples used in the strain-dependent measurements were intentionally selected to be as small and thin as possible (generally  $500\times 50\times 2\mu \mathrm{m}^3$ ), to diminish any strain relaxation effects. More details can be found in Supplementary Note 1.

ARPES. Synchrotron-based ARPES measurements were performed at beamline 5-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource with tunable photon energies from  $25\mathrm{eV}$  to  $100\mathrm{eV}$ . The spot size was  $\sim 0.04\mathrm{mm}^2$  (horizontal)  $\times 0.01\mathrm{mm}^2$  (vertical), and the equipped ScientaOmicron DA30L analyser enabled full access of the momentum space without sample rotation; both of these facts facilitated the measurements, as the typical sample width was  $\sim 50 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The light polarization used was linear vertical (along the analyser slit), with the overall energy resolution from  $10 - 20\mathrm{meV}$  and angular resolution better than  $0.2^{\circ}$ ; Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 have more detailed discussions about the photon energy and light polarization dependences of the spectra. The samples were cleaved using an exfoliation method and measured in situ at a temperature of  $\sim 10\mathrm{K}$  and a pressure lower than  $3\times 10^{-11}$  torr.

The laser-based SARPES $^{37}$  measurements were performed at the Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, which is equipped with  $6.994\mathrm{eV}$  photons and a ScientaOmicron DA30L analyser. The laser was p-polarized with a spot size of  $\sim 0.05\mathrm{mm}^2$ . Supplementary Notes 5 and 6 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 have more information about the laser polarizations and apparatus geometry. The energy (angular) resolution was set at better than  $2\mathrm{meV}$  ( $0.2^{\circ}$ ) and  $15\mathrm{meV}$  ( $0.7^{\circ}$ ) for ARPES and SARPES, respectively. The samples were cleaved using a similar method at room temperature with a pressure less than  $5\times 10^{-9}$  torr, and measured at  $\sim 10\mathrm{K}$  with a pressure less than  $7\times 10^{-11}$  torr. The spin-polarization map in Fig. 21 utilizes a two-dimensional colour coding with horizontal and vertical axes indicating the spectral weight and the polarization, respectively $^{38,39}$ .

The strain-dependent laser-ARPES measurements were performed in similar conditions to SARPES but with a ScientaOmicron R4000 analyser. The angular resolution was  $\sim 0.3^{\circ}$ , and the laser polarization was linear horizontal (along the analyser slit). More information about laser polarizations and apparatus geometry is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The samples were mounted on the strain device using silver epoxy (Muromac H-220), cleaved in situ at room temperature with a pressure less than  $1\times 10^{-10}$  torr and measured at a temperature  $< 10\mathrm{K}$  with a pressure of  $\sim 1\times 10^{-11}$  torr. The in-situ strain controls were realized by rotating the screws  $45^{\circ}$  step by step at a temperature of  $< 30\mathrm{K}$  with a pressure less than  $5\times 10^{-10}$  torr. The typical time for one  $45^{\circ}$  rotation was  $\sim 2$  min, and we confirmed that there was no surface ageing by performing strain control cycles and measuring at freshly cleaved samples with strain applied ex situ (Supplementary Fig. 10). We also show the in-situ strain-control reversibility test in Supplementary Fig. 10; the results indicate that the strain effects are completely reversible. After each measurement, we monitored the device status, and estimated and calibrated the in-situ-controlled strain magnitude to the strain measured by the strain gauges, as described below.

Strain evaluation. The strain device $^{34}$  was specially designed for the low-energy laser-ARPES apparatus. The key components of the device include two BeCu bridges, one BeCu sample platform  $(10\times 2\times 1\mathrm{mm}^3)$  and one  $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$  ball  $(1\mathrm{mm}$  diameter) below the platform. When the screws are tightened, the sample platform is bent by the bridges, providing uniaxial strain to the mounted samples, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b. As the laser spot size is small, we found no evidence of spectral broadening due to possible domains introduced by bending. Good thermal (electric) conductivity has been confirmed by comparing the spectra with those obtained from samples mounted on normal sample holders.

The strain magnitude as a function of screw angle (Fig. 3d) was measured by the commercial strain gauges (Fig. 3c, Kyowa KFGS-1N-120-C1-11) at room temperature. For both the strain gauge measurements and the strain-dependent ARPES measurements, we always carefully adjusted the screws and platforms to ensure the initial conditions of the devices were identical within error bars. Before the measurements, the heights of the four screws and the bridges were equally adjusted to ensure a flat platform. Meanwhile, the displacements between the centre of the sample platform and its contact positions with the bridges were carefully monitored, so that a zero net strain was ensured before attaching the strain gauges or mounting samples. We have conducted several strain gauge measurements on different devices and obtained similar results (two of them are shown in Fig. 3d). By fitting the data with a polynomial function (the black curve in Fig. 3d), we can estimate the strain magnitude, in situ controlled, during the ARPES measurements by interpolating at the corresponding screw angles. We also measured the displacement as a function of the strain, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 9d. Comparing to the large strain in our experiments ( $\sim 2.4\%$ ), we ignore the thermal contraction, which is typically approximately  $-0.2\%$  according to our thermal-strain simulations. The error bars for the strain magnitude controlled in the ARPES measurements were estimated in accordance with the uncertainty of the screw angles and are shown in Fig. 3d,v (smaller than the marker size in Fig. 3d).

The strain simulations based on finite element analysis were performed when the platform displacement reached  $0.124\mathrm{mm}$  (Supplementary Fig. 9d,g), using the Autodesk Inventor 2020. For the BeCu components, a Young's modulus of  $120\mathrm{GPa}$  and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3 were implemented. Figure 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9e show the simulated axial strain  $(\epsilon_{xx})$  distribution on the sample platform. The  $\epsilon_{xx}$  value reached the maximum of  $\sim 2.4\%$  at the platform centre, nicely consistent with our experimental results from the strain gauges at the same displacement (Supplementary Fig. 9d). The transverse strain  $(\epsilon_{yy})$  distribution is shown in Supplementary Fig. 9f, which reached the minimum of approximately  $-0.2\%$  at the platform centre. Supplementary Fig. 9h summarizes the overall strain distribution by plotting the  $\epsilon_{xx}$  and  $\epsilon_{yy}$  values as a function of coordinates along  $x$  ( $y = 0$ ) and along  $y$  ( $x = 0$ ), respectively. We note that the samples used for strain-dependent ARPES measurements were very small (generally  $500\times 50\times 2\mu \mathrm{m}^3$ ) and mounted at the centre of the platform. Therefore, the tiny transverse strain perpendicular to the platform is negligible. Moreover, as the samples used were also very thin, our simulations show that the strain on the sample surface was almost the same as that on the platform centre (Supplementary Fig. 9i,j). Supplementary Notes 9 and 10 have more detailed descriptions about the strain devices, strain evaluation and in-situ strain controls.

Density functional theory calculations. First, we performed the structural optimization using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional revised for solids $^{40}$  and the projector augmented wave method $^{41}$  as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package $^{42-45}$ . The spin-orbit coupling was included in all the calculations presented in this paper. Here, we optimized atomic coordinates while the lattice parameters were fixed as our experimental values. We also optimized atomic coordinates in the strain calculations, where the lattice parameters except for  $b$  (the length along the strain direction) were fixed as unstrained values for simplicity. Next, we performed first-principles band-structure calculations using the modified Becke-Johnson potential $^{46}$  as implemented in the WIEN2K code $^{47}$ . The muffin-tin radii  $r$  for Ta and Se were set to 2.5 and 2.39 a.u., respectively, for the unstrained calculation, while they were slightly changed for the strained calculations. The maximum modulus for the reciprocal lattice vectors  $K_{\mathrm{max}}$  was chosen so that  $r_{\mathrm{Se}}K_{\mathrm{max}} = 8$ . We took a  $4\times 12\times 4k$  mesh for a self-consistent-field calculation, while a following non-self-consistent-field calculation to determine the Fermi energy was performed using a finer  $k$  mesh, up to 25,000 points. From the calculated band structures, we extracted the Wannier functions of the Ta  $s$  and  $d$  orbitals and the Se  $s$  and  $p$  orbitals using the WIEN2WANNIER and WANNIER90 codes $^{48-51}$ . We did not perform the maximal localization procedure for the Wannier functions to prevent orbital mixing among the different spin components. The semi-infinite-slab tight-binding models constructed from these Wannier functions were used for calculating the surface spectra in a way described in the literature $^{52}$ . The Fermi energy in all the calculated data is shifted by  $-10\mathrm{meV}$  so as to reproduce the experimental spectra.

The tensile strain along the chain direction leads to finite compressive strain perpendicular to it, due to the Poisson effect. However, we did not take the perpendicular compressive strain into account in the density functional theory calculations of Fig. 4 since the effect is negligible and not crucial for our conclusions. To confirm this, we have performed a simulation considering Poisson's ratio and estimated the perpendicular strain to be only  $-0.2\%$  when the tensile strain along the chain direction was set to  $2.4\%$  (Supplementary Fig. 9h), which is the maximum value we applied for the samples in our experiments. Subsequently, we calculated the bulk band structure under the  $2.4\%$  tensile strain along the chain direction with and without the effect of the perpendicular compressive strain of  $-0.2\%$ ; no considerable difference was obtained between the two (Supplementary Fig. 15), leading us to conclude that the effect of the perpendicular compressive strain can be ignored in our study.
