Electro-optic modulators translate high-speed electronic signals into the optical domain and are critical components in modern telecommunication networks $^{1,2}$  and microwave-photonics systems $^{3,4}$ . They are also expected to be building blocks for emerging applications such as quantum photonics $^{5,6}$  and non-reciprocal optics $^{7,8}$ . All of these applications require chip-scale electro-optic modulators that operate at voltages compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have ultra-high electro-optic bandwidths and feature very low optical losses. Integrated modulator platforms based on materials such as silicon, indium phosphide or polymers have not yet been able to meet these requirements simultaneously because of the intrinsic limitations of the materials used. On the other hand, lithium niobate electro-optic modulators, the workhorse of the optoelectronic industry for decades $^{9}$ , have been challenging to integrate on-chip because of difficulties in microstructuring lithium niobate. The current generation of lithium niobate modulators are bulky, expensive, limited in bandwidth and require high drive voltages, and thus are unable to reach the full potential of the material. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate monolithically integrated lithium niobate electro-optic modulators that feature a CMOS-compatible drive voltage, support data rates up to 210 gigabits per second and show an on-chip optical loss of less than 0.5 decibels. We achieve this by engineering the microwave and photonic circuits to achieve high electro-optical efficiencies, ultra-low optical losses and group-velocity matching simultaneously. Our scalable modulator devices could provide cost-effective, low-power and ultra-high-speed solutions for next-generation optical communication networks and microwave photonic systems. Furthermore, our approach could lead to large-scale ultra-low-loss photonic circuits that are reconfigurable on a picosecond timescale, enabling a wide range of quantum and classical applications $^{5,10,11}$  including feed-forward photonic quantum computation.

Future photonic systems require modulators with a CMOS-compatible drive voltage, a large bandwidth, a low optical insertion loss, a high extinction ratio, excellent signal quality and compatibility with large-scale manufacturing. Because discrete lithium niobate (LN) modulators are difficult to integrate, many other photonic platforms compatible with microfabrication processes have been pursued instead, including those based on silicon $^{1,12,13}$ , indium phosphide $^{14,15}$ , polymers $^{16,17}$  and plasmonics $^{18}$ . These have shown excellent scalability and distinct performance merits, including the potential for integration with CMOS electronics (Si), low drive voltages (InP, polymer), ultra-high bandwidths (polymer, plasmonics) and small footprints (Si, plasmonics). Although the integration problem has been greatly alleviated in these platforms, a modulator that simultaneously meets all desired performance aspects remains elusive because of the non-ideal electro-optic properties of the underlying materials.

The material properties of LN are well suited for realizing ultra-fast modulation, low-voltage operation and low optical losses at the same

time. The strong electro-optic (Pockels) effect in LN leads to a linear change of its refractive index in response to an applied voltage, on femtosecond timescales $^{19}$ . Although it has been known for some time that microstructured LN devices can provide better modulator performance $^{20}$ , most commercial LN modulators are still based on titanium-indiffusion or proton-exchange waveguides, because LN is notoriously difficult to etch $^{9}$ . These waveguides typically have a low refractive index contrast  $\Delta n$  of around 0.02 between core and cladding, resulting in a large optical mode size $^{21}$ . The weak optical confinement requires metal electrodes to be spaced far apart from the optical waveguide (about  $10~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ ), lowering the electro-optic efficiency. As a result, LN modulators today are much larger in size and require much higher drive voltages than the material is capable of supporting.

In recent years, the LN-on-insulator platform has emerged as a promising candidate for integrated high-performance modulators. In this approach, a single-crystal, submicrometer-thick LN film is bonded on top of a low-index substrate (silicon dioxide,  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ ), and waveguides are created by dry etching the LN device layer[22]. This has led to a range of LN photonic devices with high index contrast of  $>0.7$  and tightly confined optical modes[23-29]. Electro-optic modulators with promising electro-optic efficiencies have been demonstrated[25-27,29]. However, the actual switching voltages, bandwidths and optical losses in these demonstrations still suffer from critical trade-offs, limited by non-ideal etching, reduced overlap between electrical and optical fields, and/or the inefficient microwave signal delivery. Whether it is possible to simultaneously achieve a low on/off switching voltage, an ultra-high bandwidth and a low optical loss in LN modulators has remained an outstanding question.

Here we demonstrate monolithically integrated LN electro-optic modulators (Fig. 1) that overcome such trade-offs, featuring a switching voltage of  $1.4\mathrm{V}$  while supporting very high bandwidths. Our integrated modulators operate in a travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration that uses highly confined copropagating microwave and optical fields with matched group velocities and low propagation losses. A 50:50 Y-junction splits the input light into two LN optical waveguides that form the arms of the MZI. The optical waveguides run through the dielectric gaps of a ground-signal-ground coplanar microwave strip line (Fig. 1d). As a result, the microwave electric field has opposite signs across the two LN waveguides, thus inducing (through the Pockels effect) an optical phase delay on one arm and an optical phase advance on the other. This optical phase difference results in constructive/destructive interference at the output 50:50 Y-junction, and thereby an amplitude modulation of the output optical signal (Fig. 1c). An important figure of merit for MZI modulators is the half-wave voltage  $(V_{\pi})$ , defined as the voltage required to induce a  $\pi$ -phase difference between the two modulator arms, changing the optical transmission from maximum to minimum. For a device with 20-mm-long microwave strip line electrodes, we measure a low  $V_{\pi}$  of  $1.4\mathrm{V}$  (Fig. 1c), which allows the modulator to be directly driven by a CMOS circuit. Importantly, our devices also

Fig. 1 | Nanophotonic LN modulators compatible with CMOS drive voltages. a, b, Schematic comparison of the data-transmitting set-ups for integrated (a) and traditional (b) LN modulators. The nanophotonic LN modulator (a) supports direct CMOS driving with high bandwidths  $(>100\mathrm{GHz})$ , while traditional modulators (b) require large and power-consuming electrical driver amplifiers and have limited bandwidths (approximately  $35\mathrm{GHz}$ ). c, Normalized optical transmission of a  $20\mathrm{-mm}$

feature a high optical power extinction ratio of about 30 dB between on and off states (see Methods).

In the travelling-wave electrode configuration, longer microwave strip lines could be used to induce a larger optical phase shift, thus reducing the  $V_{\pi}$  value. However, this degrades the electro-optic bandwidth, owing to exacerbated mismatch between microwave and optical velocities, and larger microwave loss. This contradictory requirement on electrode length results in a voltage-bandwidth trade-off<sup>9</sup>. In traditional LN modulators, the large optical mode size requires the metal electrodes to be placed far from the optical waveguides, and very long electrodes are required to reduce the voltage to even modest levels. As a result, the voltage-bandwidth performance of these modulators is typically limited to  $V_{\pi}$  about 3.5 V and bandwidth about 35 GHz, requiring power-consuming electrical amplifiers to drive them (Fig. 1b)<sup>9</sup>.

In contrast, the thin-film LN modulator can overcome the bandwidth-voltage performance limitation by maximizing the electro-optic overlap using photonic structures with a strong optical confinement[25,26,29]. Owing to the increased modulation efficiency, our devices are much shorter (ranging from  $5\mathrm{mm}$  to  $20\mathrm{mm}$ ) than conventional counterparts (typically  $>5\mathrm{cm}$ ), while allowing for  $V_{\pi}$  values at CMOS levels (Fig. 1a). Moreover, as the optical mode is highly localized in the submicrometre waveguide region whereas the microwave mode resides largely in the substrate, it is possible to engineer the microwave and

The measured extinction ratio is 30 dB. d, Microscope image of the fabricated chip consisting of three Mach-Zehnder modulators with various microwave signal line widths and device lengths.

optical group velocities independently, by designing the layer thicknesses of the  $\mathrm{LN} / \mathrm{SiO}_2 / \mathrm{Si}$  stack (see Methods). As a result, our devices can maintain velocity matching between the optical and the microwave signals at very high microwave frequencies without sacrificing the electro-optic overlap. Figure 2a presents the measured small-signal electro-optic response of the  $20\mathrm{-mm}$ -long device, showing a high 3-dB bandwidth of  $>45\mathrm{GHz}$ . These devices also possess ultra-low on-chip optical losses of  $<0.5\mathrm{dB}$  (see Methods) $^{28}$ .

We use the low-voltage, high-bandwidth and low-loss integrated modulators to demonstrate data modulation at  $70\mathrm{Gbit}s^{-1}$  directly driven by a CMOS circuit (Fig. 2b-d). High-speed electrical signals are generated by a CMOS digital-to-analogue conversion (DAC) circuit and directly used to drive our modulator without an electrical amplifier. Figure 2c, d shows measured constellation diagrams (Fig. 2c, d, left) from a coherent receiver, which recovers both amplitude and phase of the output optical field at each data-sampling instant. The vertical and horizontal axes correspond to the in-phase and quadrature components of the measured optical fields. Distinct constellations with fewer overlapping data points between '0' and '1' correspond to the desired lower bit-error ratios (BER). The eye diagrams (Fig. 2c, d right) are generated by up-sampling the received digital data for better visualization (see Methods). Low BERs correspond to clear separation between the discrete data levels at the sampling time (i.e. middle of the eye diagrams). At a peak-to-peak drive voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{pp}})$  of  $200\mathrm{mV}$ , the modulated optical

signal yields error-free performance within the  $1.1 \times 10^{6}$  captured signal bits: that is,  $\mathrm{BER} < 1 \times 10^{-6}$  (Fig. 2c). In this case, the electrical energy dissipation within our modulator is  $0.37\mathrm{fJ}\mathrm{bit}^{-1}$  (see Methods). The system can also operate at a further reduced driving voltage of  $V_{\mathrm{pp}} = 60\mathrm{mV}$ , with a BER of  $3.4 \times 10^{-3}$  (Fig. 2d). In this case, the electrical energy dissipation of the modulator is further reduced to  $37\mathrm{aJ}\mathrm{bit}^{-1}$ . We note that the overall energy consumption of the complete data-transmission system is dominated by off-chip components, including CMOS DAC, laser, receiver set-up and analogue-to-digital converters. It is important to consider the whole system when assessing the overall system energy requirements.

The high electro-optic bandwidth and excellent signal fidelity of our modulator allow for data transmission at even higher rates, currently up to  $210\mathrm{Gbit}s^{-1}$ . To achieve this, we amplify the electrical signals from the CMOS DAC to a  $V_{\mathrm{pp}}$  of about  $2.5\mathrm{V}$  (Fig. 3a). We first test our modulator at an ultra-high symbol rate of  $10^{11}$  symbols per second (100 Gbaud) (Fig. 3b; see Methods) $^{30}$ . The BER of  $7.8\times 10^{-5}$  in this case is limited by distortion from the electrical source at high frequencies: the electrical BER at 100 Gbaud without any electrical-to-opticalto-electrical conversion is  $3.6\times 10^{-5}$  (see Methods). We then use multi-level modulation formats at 70 Gbaud to further increase the data rates and to interrogate the signal quality (that is, signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) of our modulator. Using four-level amplitude shift keying (4-ASK)—that is, encoding two bits in each symbol—we can achieve a data-transmission rate of  $140\mathrm{Gbit}s^{-1}$ , with a low BER of  $2.1\times 10^{-5}$ . In the case of 8-ASK (three bits per symbol), the modulator transmits a total data rate of  $210\mathrm{Gbit}s^{-1}$ . The measured BER of  $1.5\times 10^{-2}$  is within the tolerance of forward error correction with a  $20\%$  overhead (tolerable  $\mathrm{BER} = 1.9\times 10^{-2}$ ). For the 8-ASK modulation, the electrical energy dissipation of our modulator is  $14\mathrm{fJ}\mathrm{bit}^{-1}$  (see Methods). The high SNR demonstrated here results from a combination of high extinction ratio, low optical loss, linear electro-optic response and the absence of modulation-induced absorption. This further indicates that our devices have maintained the excellent signal fidelity of conventional LN modulators.

We show that the integrated LN platform offers greatly improved overall performance (voltage, bandwidth and optical loss) over traditional LN modulators and other material platforms. By reducing the device

The low-frequency (red line) and high-frequency (orange crosses) measurements are performed using a vector network analyser (VNA) and an optical spectrum analyser (OSA), respectively. c, Comparison of key modulator figure of merit  $(\mathrm{BW} / V_{\pi},$  ratio between 3-dB electro-optic bandwidth BW and half-wave voltage  $V_{\pi})$  for this work, for state-of-the-art commercial LN modulators and for previous thin-film LN modulators, showing much higher  $\mathrm{BW} / V_{\pi}$  values of about  $30\mathrm{GHzV^{-1}}$  for this work. The dotted lines correspond to constant values of  $\mathrm{BW} / V_{\pi}$ . d, In comparison with other material platforms with high bandwidths, the integrated LN modulators show much lower  $V_{\pi}$  and much lower on-chip optical loss at the same time. The optical losses in the active modulation regions are used for fair comparison between different platforms. Detailed references for the data shown in c and d can be found in the Methods.

![](images/7b94b241c0d321df231c6a9936d68e9c23ec628360a772a6e0f26aa2991cecf1.jpg)

length to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  and  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , we further expand the 3-dB electro-optic bandwidths to  $80\mathrm{GHz}$  and  $100\mathrm{GHz}$ , respectively (Fig. 4a, b), which are measured using an optical spectrum analyser (see Methods) $^{31}$ . The measured  $V_{\pi}$  values for these devices are  $2.3\mathrm{V}$  and  $4.4\mathrm{V}$ , respectively (see Methods). Further optimizing the microwave losses of the transmission lines could allow for electro-optic bandwidths of  $>100\mathrm{GHz}$  while maintaining a CMOS-level voltage. Nevertheless, our modulators already represent better voltage-bandwidth performance (about  $30\mathrm{GHzV}^{-1}$ ) than commercial LN modulators and previously reported thin-film LN devices, as illustrated in Fig. 4c. The ultra-high bandwidth of these modulators could allow for data operation beyond 200 Gbaud. Furthermore, in contrast to other high-speed modulator platforms in which the optical materials or modulation mechanisms are often inherently lossy, our integrated LN platform breaks the traditional trade-off between modulation voltage and propagation loss, allowing for low optical loss and low  $V_{\pi}$  at the same time (Fig. 4d). Given the voltage-loss performance of our platform, it should be possible to use even longer devices to further reduce the  $V_{\pi}$  to well below  $1\mathrm{V}$  while maintaining an on-chip insertion loss of below  $1\mathrm{dB}$ .

The results presented here show that ultra-high-performance integrated LN modulators have the properties desired for future high-bandwidth and low-power-consumption data communications. By combining the excellent signal fidelity with advanced in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator designs, a single integrated LN modulator could transmit more than  $1\mathrm{Tb}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  of data per polarization, using, for example, 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) at 200 Gbaud. Using meandering optical waveguides and microwave transmission lines could lead to modulators with even smaller footprint while maintaining CMOS-compatible voltages. This could open opportunities for direct optoelectronic integration of switching components with

application-specific integrated circuits $^2$ . Furthermore, the low optical and microwave losses, linear electro-optic response, scalability and the ability to be integrated with other photonic components (such as filters and delay lines) could inspire a new generation of active integrated optoelectronic circuits that can be reconfigured on a picosecond timescale using attojoules of electrical energy. These applications include large-scale gigahertz switching networks for quantum photonics $^5$ , radio signal processing in the optical domain for microwave photonics $^4$ , self-aware optical networks $^{10}$ , non-reciprocal devices $^8$ , topological photonic circuits $^{32}$  and photonic neural networks $^{11}$ .

# METHODS

Device fabrication. Devices are fabricated from a commercial x-cut LN-on-insulator wafer (NANOLN), in which a 600-nm device layer sits on top of a  $\mathrm{SiO}_2/$  Si-stack substrate. We use electron-beam lithography (EBL) and  $\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$ -based reactive ion etching to define optical waveguides and MZIs in thin-film LN, using a similar process as described in our previous work[28]. A  $1.5\text{-}\mu \mathrm{m}$ -thick polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) EBL resist is spin-coated and exposed, again using EBL with alignment, to define the microwave transmission line patterns. The PMMA resist is used for a lift-off process to produce the  $1.1\text{-}\mu \mathrm{m}$ -thick gold strip lines. High-precision alignment between the two layers is required to prevent excessive propagation loss from the metal electrodes. The structures are then cladded with an  $800\text{-}\mathrm{nm}$ -thick  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Finally, the chip edges are diced and polished to improve the fibre-to-chip coupling.

Electro-optic characterization. Electro-optic characterization is performed in the telecommunications C-band using a tunable-wavelength laser source (Santec TSL-510). A three-paddle polarization controller is used to ensure transverse-electric mode excitation. Light is butt-coupled into and out of the chip under test using tapered lensed fibres, with a coupling loss of about 5 dB per facet. We have previously done extensive studies on the dependence of waveguide propagation loss on the waveguide geometry[28]. In the current work, we use a waveguide top width of  $800\mathrm{nm}$  to ensure single-mode operation. The corresponding propagation loss is approximately  $0.2\mathrm{dBcm}^{-1}$ , higher than the best value reported in our previous work[28] owing to more sidewall scattering losses in the narrower waveguide. This results in an overall on-chip phase-shifter insertion loss of  $<0.5\mathrm{dB}$ , as estimated by comparing fibre-to-fibre transmission signals for our modulators (total waveguide lengths  $>3\mathrm{cm}$ ) and bare waveguides with short total lengths. Within the measurement uncertainty  $(\pm 0.5\mathrm{dB})$ , we did not observe measurable loss difference for the two types of devices, thus extracting an upper bound of on-chip losses of  $0.5\mathrm{dB}$ . For our  $V_{\pi}$  measurement, a triangular voltage signal  $(V_{\mathrm{pp}} = 5\mathrm{V})$  is used to drive the modulator while the optical transmission signal is monitored in real time. A pair of high-speed microwave probes (GGB) is used to deliver the modulation signal to the input port of the transmission line, and to terminate the output of the transmission line with a  $50 - \Omega$  load. The electro-optic response below  $45\mathrm{GHz}$  is measured with a vector network analyser in a set-up similar to that used in our previous work[25].

Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the half-wave voltage measurements for three devices characterized, with active device lengths of  $20\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $10\mathrm{mm}$  and  $5\mathrm{mm}$ . The inset of Extended Data Fig. 1a shows the optical transmission on a logarithmic scale, indicating a measured device extinction ratio of  $30\mathrm{dB}$ . The high experimental extinction ratio also implies a high fabrication quality for the Y-junctions, with a nearly ideal 50:50 split ratio. The extinction ratio could be further improved by using directional couplers. The measured  $V_{\pi}$  values for the  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  and  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  devices are  $2.3\mathrm{V}$  and  $4.4\mathrm{V}$ , corresponding to voltage-length products of  $2.3\mathrm{Vcm}$  and  $2.2\mathrm{Vcm}$ , respectively.

Ultra-high-speed device characterization. The electro-optic response from  $35\mathrm{GHz}$  to  $100\mathrm{GHz}$  is tested with an optical spectrum analyser (Extended Data Fig. 2a) $^{31}$ . A sinusoidal signal  $(f_{\mathrm{i}})$  from a high-speed synthesizer (up to  $50\mathrm{GHz}$ ) is used to drive a commercial LN Mach-Zehnder modulator, which has a 3-dB bandwidth of about  $35\mathrm{GHz}$ , with the frequency response gradually rolling off thereafter. The modulator is biased at the transmission null to suppress the carrier frequency, resulting in an output optical signal with two sidebands separated by twice the input frequency  $(2f_{\mathrm{i}})$ . A  $100\mathrm{GHz}$  photodetector is used to beat the two sidebands and generate a microwave signal up to  $100\mathrm{GHz}$ , which is subsequently used to drive the modulator under test. The modulator optical response is measured by monitoring the sideband power in the optical spectrum analyser. We calibrate the synthesizer output power, the electro-optic response of the commercial Mach-Zehnder modulator and the  $100\mathrm{GHz}$  photodetector response over the frequency range of interest to ensure an accurate characterization of our devices. Note that the actual measurement is performed using a pair of  $67\mathrm{GHz}$  probes (one for microwave signal modulation and the other for  $50\Omega$  termination). The frequency response of the probes is not de-embedded due to the lack of manufacturer data. Therefore, the bandwidth reported here is a lower bound for our devices.

The measurement set-up for high-speed data modulation is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2b. Electrical signals up to 70 Gbaud are directly generated from a CMOS DAC circuit (Socionext OOLA DAC, 3-dB analogue bandwidth 15 GHz, 13-dB analogue bandwidth 35 GHz). The transmitter uses a digital pulse-shaping filter to limit the signal to its Nyquist bandwidth (for example, 35 GHz electrical bandwidth for a 70-Gbaud signal). The electrical signals from the DAC have a peak-to-peak voltage of  $\sim 0.2\mathrm{V}$  and can be further amplified or attenuated before being used to drive the modulator under test. The modulator is biased at the transmission null point to generate binary phase-shift keying, 4-ASK and 8-ASK[33]. The output optical signal is mixed with a local oscillator in an optical hybrid and is sent into a single-polarization phase-diversity coherent receiver with a pair of balanced 45-GHz photodetectors to extract the in-phase and quadrature components of the modulated light field. Digitized data are collected using an 80-GSa/s real-time oscilloscope

with an analogue bandwidth of 63 GHz (Keysight DSOZ634A). The collected data are post-processed using least-mean-square adaptive filters to equalize the optical channel response, and to generate the constellation diagrams. The eye diagrams are plotted by up-sampling the real part of the recovered constellations using an interpolation filter for better visualization. At 100 Gbaud, the electrical signal is generated by up-conversion and interleaving two 35-GHz electrical signals<sup>30</sup>. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows the electrical eye diagram at 100 Gbaud, with a BER of  $3.6 \times 10^{-5}$ , limited by the signal distortion from the electronic circuit. This electrical BER floor translates directly into the BER floor of the optically modulated signal at 100 Gbaud.

For optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) measurement, the modulator output optical signal is attenuated to different levels before being amplified, which produces the desired OSNR values, before entering the coherent receiver. The measured OSNR curves are plotted in Extended Data Fig. 4.

Microwave transmission line and velocity matching. Extended Data Fig. 5a, b shows the cross-sectional schematics of the integrated LN modulator and a conventional LN modulator. Extended Data Fig. 5c, d shows the numerically simulated microwave and optical field distributions. The simulations are performed using the finite element method (COMSOL Multiphysics). Owing to the high optical confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5d) in the thin-film LN platform, we can design the metal electrodes to be placed close to the waveguides (spacing  $< 2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  between metal and waveguide edge) without substantially increasing the optical losses (simulated metal absorption loss  $< 0.03\mathrm{dBcm}^{-1}$ ). We design the waveguide width, ridge height and metal gap to achieve a much higher electro-optic efficiency than conventional LN modulators.

More importantly, the  $\mathrm{SiO_2 / Si}$  -stack substrate in our platform can be independently designed as a microwave dielectric to realize optimal microwave-optical group velocity matching without sacrificing electro-optic overlap. In conventional LN modulators, velocity matching is a non-trivial task because of the large discrepancy between the dielectric constants of LN at microwave  $(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{RF}} = 28)$  and optical  $(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{opt}} = 5)$  frequencies. As a result, a buffer  $\mathrm{SiO_2}$  layer is used to overcome the large group-velocity mismatch between microwave and optical signals (Extended Data Fig. 5b), which further reduces the already suboptimal electro-optic efficiency. In our platform, we design the thickness of the buried  $\mathrm{SiO_2}$  layer and the material of the handle substrate (Si in this case) to achieve velocity matching without sacrificing electro-optic overlap. We design the coplanar waveguide signal linewidth and the substrate  $\mathrm{SiO_2}$  thickness such that the group refractive indices for microwave and optics are both approximately 2.2 (Extended Data Fig. 5e), and that the transmission line has an impedance near  $50\Omega$  . The final device has a LN slab thickness of  $300~\mathrm{nm}$  , a buried  $\mathrm{SiO_2}$  layer thickness of  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  and a Si substrate thickness of  $500\mu \mathrm{m}$

Modulator energy consumption. Because our modulator uses a transmission line configuration with a 50-Ω load, the electrical energy per bit dissipated in the modulator can be estimated as  $W_{\mathrm{e}} = V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} / (BR)$ , where  $V_{\mathrm{rms}}$  is the root-mean-square drive voltage,  $B$  is the bit-rate and  $R$  is the driver impedance<sup>16</sup>.

For direct CMOS modulation at 70 Gbit  $s^{-1}$  (Fig. 2c, d), the electrical root-mean-square voltage  $V_{\mathrm{rms}} = 36 \mathrm{mV}$ , resulting in a low electrical energy consumption of 0.37 fJ bit $^{-1}$ . For the 210 Gbit  $s^{-1}$  data modulation in Fig. 3d, the electrical  $V_{\mathrm{rms}}$  is 360 mV, resulting in an electrical energy consumption of 14 fJ bit $^{-1}$ .

The energy consumption of the entire data-transmission system also includes the power consumption of CMOS DAC, laser, optical amplifiers and analogue-to-digital converter.

Modulator figures of merit comparison. Extended Data Table 1 lists the detailed numbers ( $V_{\pi}$  values, 3-dB electro-optic bandwidths and phase-shifter losses) and references of previously demonstrated thin-film LN modulators[25,26,29,34,35], commercial LN modulators[36-38], and modulators based on silicon[39-42], InP[14,43,44], polymers[45,46] and plasmonics[18,47,48]. These numbers are used in Fig. 4c, d. The loss numbers plotted in Fig. 4d consider only the loss of the active modulation regions, excluding the coupling and splitter losses, to provide a comparison of modulation-induced optical absorption between different material platforms and modulation schemes. In practical applications, other important performance merits, including footprint, extinction ratio, modulator linearity, thermal stability and power handling, should also be considered. Also, the comparison here is only on the device level. In practical data-transmission settings, the performance of other components, such as the driving circuits, also needs to be considered.
