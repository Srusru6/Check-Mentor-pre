Over the past decade, strong interactions of light and matter at the single-photon level have enabled a wide set of scientific advances in quantum optics and quantum information science. This work has been performed principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics $^{1-4}$  with diverse physical systems $^{5}$ , including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators $^{1,6}$ , quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities $^{7,8}$  and Cooper pairs interacting with superconducting resonators $^{9,10}$ . Experiments with single, localized atoms have been at the forefront of these advances $^{11-15}$  with the use of optical resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations $^{16}$ . As a result of the extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer dielectric mirror coatings $^{17}$  of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems $^{5}$ . Here we show strong coupling between individual caesium atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity. Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications include the implementation of quantum networks $^{18,19}$ , scalable quantum logic with photons $^{20}$ , and quantum information processing on atom chips $^{21}$ .

The realization of large-scale quantum networks $^{18,19}$  requires the capability to inter-connect many 'quantum nodes', each of which could consist of a microresonator containing a set of trapped atoms. The 'quantum channels' to connect these nodes would be optical fibres, with strong interactions in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) providing an efficient interface between light and matter. Here we provide a critical step towards a feasible quantum network by demonstrating strong coupling of single atoms to microresonators fabricated on silicon wafers in large numbers by standard lithographic techniques followed by a laser-reflow process $^{22}$ . Combined with the capability to couple light efficiently to and from such cavities directly via a tapered optical fibre $^{23}$ , toroidal microcavities offer promising capabilities for new nonlinear interactions of single atoms and photons across distributed networks.

Our efforts follow the pioneering work of V. Braginsky et al.[24] and later studies[25] by employing the whispering-gallery modes of fused silica microtoroidal resonators[26]. As shown in Fig. 1, a silicon chip containing a collection of 35 microtoroidal resonators is located

inside a vacuum chamber at  $10^{-9}$  Torr and is positioned to couple a particular resonator to a tapered fibre. The toroids have major diameter  $D \approx 44\mu \mathrm{m}$  and minor diameter  $d \approx 6\mu \mathrm{m}$  (ref. 26). By judicious choice of the point of contact between the surface of the resonator and the tapered fibre, we attain critical coupling, in which the forward propagating power  $P_{\mathrm{F}}$  in the fibre drops to near zero for the probe frequency  $\omega_{\mathrm{p}}$  equal to the cavity resonance frequency  $\omega_{\mathrm{C}}$  (ref. 23). Measurements of the cavity transmission in the absence of atoms are presented in Fig. 2. Note that the forward flux  $P_{\mathrm{F}}$  and the associated transmission spectrum  $T_{\mathrm{F}}$  are analogous to the reflected flux and reflection spectrum from a Fabry-Perot cavity[23]. By varying the temperature of the silicon chip, the detuning  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}} \equiv \omega_{\mathrm{C}} - \omega_{\mathrm{A}}$  between  $\omega_{\mathrm{C}}$  and the atomic resonance at  $\omega_{\mathrm{A}}$  ( $6S_{1/2}$ ;  $F = 4 \rightarrow 6P_{3/2}$ ;  $F' = 5'$  transition in caesium) can be controlled with an uncertainty of  $\pm 2\mathrm{MHz}$  (Supplementary Information).

The lower trace is taken for critical coupling, and the upper trace for conditions of under-coupling<sup>23</sup>. From fits to such traces for critical coupling (red dashed curve), we find that  $(\kappa, h) / 2\pi = (17.9 \pm 2.8, 4.9 \pm 1.3) \mathrm{MHz}$ , with  $\kappa, h$  being the overall cavity field decay rate and the scattering-induced coupling between the two counter-propagating modes of the microtoroid, respectively (see Supplementary Information for more details). Inset: photograph of a microtoroid and coupling fibre.

Cold atoms are delivered to the vicinity of the toroidal resonator from a small cloud of caesium atoms cooled to  $T \approx 10\mu \mathrm{K}$  and located  $10\mathrm{mm}$  above the silicon chip. Every 5 s, the cloud is dropped, resulting in about  $2\times 10^{6}$  atoms in a 3-mm ball at the height of the chip, with then a few dozen atoms passing through the external evanescent field of the toroidal resonator. By way of two single-photon detectors  $(\mathrm{D_{F1}},\mathrm{D_{F2}})$  (Supplementary Information), we continuously monitor the forward propagating signal  $P_{\mathrm{F}}$  from a frequency-stabilized probe beam  $P_{\mathrm{in}}$  coupled to the toroidal resonator. The interaction of an individual atom with the evanescent field destroys the condition of critical coupling, leading to an increase in

$P_{\mathrm{F}}$  The measurement cycle then repeats itself for  $2.5\mathrm{s}$  for a reference measurement, this time with no atomic cloud formed above the microtoroid.

Figure 3 displays typical records  $C(t)$  for the number of single-photon detection events within time bins of  $\delta t = 2\mu s$  as functions of time  $t$  for the forward signal  $P_{\mathrm{F}}(t)$ . Measurements are displayed with (Fig. 3a) and without (Fig. 3b) atoms for the case of equal probe and cavity frequencies,  $\omega_{\mathrm{p}} = \omega_{\mathrm{C}}$ , for  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}} \approx 0$ , and with mean intracavity photon number  $n_0 \approx 0.3$  for the forward circulating mode  $a$  of the toroidal resonator (Supplementary Information). The traces in both Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b exhibit background levels that result from the nonzero ratio  $P_{\mathrm{F}} / P_{\mathrm{in}} \approx 0.005$  at critical coupling in the absence of atoms. However, Fig. 3a clearly shows sharp peaks of duration  $\Delta t \approx 2\mu s$  for the forward-propagating light  $P_{\mathrm{F}}(t)$ , with an individual peak shown more clearly in the inset. Each event arises from the transit of a single atom through the resonant mode of the microtoroid, with about 30 events per cycle observed. Figure 3c examines the temporal profile of transit events in more detail by way of the cross-correlation  $\Gamma(\tau)$  of photoelectric counts  $C_1(t_1)$  and  $C_2(t_1 + \tau)$  from the detectors  $D_{\mathrm{F1}}$  and  $D_{\mathrm{F2}}$  for  $P_{\mathrm{F}}$  (Supplementary Information). This result agrees reasonably well with the theoretical prediction for atom transits through the calculated field distribution shown in Fig. 1b.

By applying a threshold requiring  $C(t) \geq 6$  counts for  $C(t)$  as in Fig. 3a, b, we find the average time dependence  $\bar{C}_{\geq 6}(t)$  over about 100 measurement cycles. Figure 3d displays the results both with and without atoms, with the average counts  $\sum_{6}(t)$  derived from  $\bar{C}_{\geq 6}(t)$  by summing over successive time bins  $\delta t = 2\mu s$  for 1-ms intervals. The peak in transit events is consistent with the expected distribution of arrival times for atoms dropped from our atom cloud. By contrast, negligible excess events (that is,  $C(t) \geq 6$ ) are recorded for the cases without atoms.

Focusing attention to the central region indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 3d, we examine in Fig. 3e the probability  $P(C)$  of recording  $C$  counts within  $\delta t = 2\mu s$ . Evidently, when the atom

The excess probability above the poissonian level in the no atoms case is predominantly due to instability in the cavity temperature, which results in small fluctuations in the forward flux. Error bars show  $\pm 1$  s.d.

cloud is present, there is a statistically significant increase (of at least  $15\sigma$ ) in the number of events with  $C \geq 4$ . These are precisely the events illustrated by the inset in Fig. 3a and the cross-correlation in Fig. 3c, and are associated with single-atom transits near the surface of the toroidal resonator. By varying the value of  $n_0$  we have confirmed that the large transit events evident in Fig. 3 are markedly decreased for  $n_0 \geq 1$  photons, which indicates the saturation of the atom-cavity system.

A quantitative description of our observations in Fig. 3 of individual atom transits requires the development of a new theoretical model in cavity QED. In the Supplementary Information we present such a model and show that the underlying description of the interaction of an atom with the fields of the toroidal resonator is in terms of normal modes (A,B) (Supplementary Fig. 1), which have mode functions  $\psi_{\mathrm{A,B}}(\rho ,x,z)$  that are standing waves (cos  $kx$  sin  $kx$  around the circumference  $x$  of the toroid, with  $\rho$  the radial distance from the surface and  $z$  the vertical coordinate. Mode functions  $\psi_{\mathrm{A,B}}(\rho ,x,z)$  have a calculated peak coherent coupling  $g_0 / 2\pi$  of  $70\mathrm{MHz}$  for the lowest-order modes of our resonator (such as that illustrated in Fig. 1b). The normal modes A,B result from the coupling of two oppositely directed travelling waves by scattering at rate  $h$  with the resulting mode splitting seen in Fig. 2. Note that the presence of two normal modes leads to a  $\sqrt{2}$  increase in the coupling constant in our case in contrast with that predicted by the Jaynes-Cummings model for an atom interacting with a single travelling-wave mode (see Supplementary Information for further details).

Guided by this theory, we have performed a series of measurements similar to those presented in Fig. 3 to determine the coherent coupling rate  $g_{0}$  for interactions of single atoms with our toroidal resonator, but now with various values of the atom-cavity detuning  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$ , keeping the probe resonant with the cavity:  $\omega_{\mathrm{C}} \approx \omega_{\mathrm{p}} = \omega_{\mathrm{A}} + \Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$ .

qualitative idea is that large single-atom transit events will occur only over a range of detunings  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$  determined by  $g_0$ . Specifically, the decrease in the forward transmission  $T_{\mathrm{F}}$  induced by atom transits as a function of  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$  is described by a lorentzian with width  $\beta$  set by  $g_0$  (Supplementary Information). In our case,  $g_0 = g_0(\rho ,x,z)\approx$ $g_0(\rho ,x,Vt)$ , where  $V$  is the velocity of the dropped atoms in the  $z$  direction. Thus, a numerical integration was performed over  $\rho ,x$  and  $t$  to derive the theoretical expectation for  $T_{\mathrm{F}}(\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}})$  presented in Fig. 4a for three values of  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}}$ , where  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}}$  is the maximal coupling that an atom can experience in its interaction with the cavity modes. Indeed, we see that the width  $\beta$  grows monotonically with  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}}$ . However, the average value of  $T_{\mathrm{F}}$  is not readily measured in our current experiment, in which we expect many short individual transits, some of which are too weak to be distinguished from the background noise (see Fig. 3e). A parameter that describes our actual experimental measurements more closely is the probability of obtaining a transit that results in transmission above a certain threshold. The two measures are closely related, such that this probability decreases with detuning  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$  in the same fashion as  $T_{\mathrm{F}}$ .

Figure 4b-d presents the results of our measurements for the average number of transit events per atom drop,  $N_{\mathrm{drop}}^{\mathrm{av}}(C \geq C_0)$ , which have photoelectric counts greater than or equal to a threshold value  $C_0$  for a set of seven detunings  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$ . In accord with the expectation set by Fig. 4a, there is a decrease in the occurrence of large transit events for increasing  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}}$  in correspondence to the decrease in the effective atom-cavity coupling coefficient for large atom-cavity detunings. The full curves shown in Fig. 4b-d are the results of theoretical calculation for these measurements, with the relevant cavity parameters  $(\kappa, h)$  determined from fits as in Fig. 2.

We first ask whether the data might be explained by an effective value  $g_0^{\mathrm{e}}$  for the coherent coupling of atom and cavity field, without taking into account the fact that individual atoms transit at radial distances  $\rho$  that vary from atom to atom. Figure 4b examines this possibility for various values of  $g_0^{\mathrm{e}}$ , assuming a coupling coefficient  $g_0^{\mathrm{e}}\psi_{\mathrm{A,B}}(x) = g_0^{\mathrm{e}}[\cos kx,\sin kx]$ , averaged along one period in  $x$  (as in Fig. 4a). Apparently, an effective value  $g_0^{\mathrm{e}} / 2\pi = 40\mathrm{MHz}$  provides reasonable correspondence between theory and experiment for large events  $C \geq 6$ .

We adapt our theory to the actual situation of atoms arriving randomly at radial and circumferential coordinates by introducing a mesh grid over  $(\rho, x)$ , and then computing the cavity transmission function  $T_{\mathrm{F}}(t)$  from  $\psi_{\mathrm{A,B}}(\rho, x, z(t))$  for atomic trajectories  $z(t)$  over this grid. We account for the time resolution  $\delta t = 2\mu s$  of our data acquisition by a suitable average of  $T_{\mathrm{F}}(t)$  over such time bins (as was also true in Fig. 4b). The results from these calculations are shown in Fig. 4c, d as the set of full curves for three values of coherent coupling  $g_0$  for the cavity mode functions  $\psi_{\mathrm{A,B}}(\rho, x, z)$ , where in Fig. 4b-d the theory is scaled to match the measured  $N_{\mathrm{drop}}^{\mathrm{av}}(C \geq C_0)$  at  $\Delta_{\mathrm{AC}} = 0$ . From such comparisons we determine a maximal accessible  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}} / 2\pi$  of  $50 \pm 12 \mathrm{MHz}$ . This conclusion is insensitive to the choice of cut-off  $C_0$  over the range  $4 \leq C_0 \leq 9$  for which we have significant transit events. Strong coupling with  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}} > (\kappa, \gamma)$  is thereby achieved, where  $(\kappa, \gamma) / 2\pi = (17.9 \pm 2.8, 2.6)$  MHz are the dissipative rates for the cavity field and the atom.

According to our calculations,  $g_0^{\mathrm{m}} / 2\pi = 50\mathrm{MHz}$  corresponds to the coupling rate expected at a distance of roughly  $45\mathrm{nm}$  from the surface of the microtoroid. We estimate that due to the attractive van der Waals forces[27], atoms which enter the evanescent field with a distance  $\rho \leq 45\mathrm{nm}$  from the microtoroid are expected to strike its surface in less than  $1\mu \mathrm{s}$ , thus preventing such atoms from generating appreciable transit events in the transmission function  $T_{\mathrm{F}}$ .

Thus, we report strong coupling for single atoms interacting with an optical resonator other than a conventional Fabry-Perot cavity. The monolithic microtoroidal resonators[22] employed here have the capability of input-output coupling with small parasitic losses, with a demonstrated ideality of more than  $99.97\%$ [23]. Moreover, quality factors  $Q = 4 \times 10^{8}$  have been realized at  $\lambda = 1,550\mathrm{nm}$  (ref. 28) and

$Q \approx 10^{8}$  at  $\lambda = 850\mathrm{nm}$  (ref. 26), with good prospects for improvements to  $Q \approx 10^{10}$  (ref. 29). For these parameters, the efficiency for coupling single photons into and out of the resonator could approach  $\varepsilon \sim 0.99 - 0.999$  (ref. 23), while still remaining firmly in the regime of strong coupling $^{26}$ . Such high efficiency is critical for the realization of scalable quantum networks $^{18,19}$  and photonic quantum computation $^{20}$ . Indeed, of the diverse possibilities for the distribution and processing of quantum information with optical cavities $^{5,7,8}$ , the system of single atoms coupled to microtoroidal resonators arguably provides one of the most promising avenues. Beyond efficient input-output coupling $^{23}$ , strong coupling to a material system with long-lived internal states has now been showed, although here in a primitive, proof-of-principle setting. An outstanding technical challenge is to trap single atoms near the surface of the microtoroid, with one possibility having been investigated in ref. 30.
